<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most holy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it is most holy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest's that offereth it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span> have, one as much as another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that be clean shall eat thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Speak unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth it shall be cut off from his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Speak unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be <span class="person">Aaron</span>'s and his sons'. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> He among the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for his part. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> This is the portion of the anointing of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest's office; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for ever throughout their generations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> Which the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span> in mount <span class="place">Sinai</span>, in the day that he commanded the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>.

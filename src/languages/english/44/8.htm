<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And <span class="person">Saul</span> was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of <span class="place">Judaea</span> and <span class="place">Samaria</span>, except the apostles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And devout men carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> As for <span class="person">Saul</span>, he made havock of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Then <span class="person">Philip</span> went down to the city of <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and preached <span class="person">Christ</span> unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which <span class="person">Philip</span> spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And there was great joy in that city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> But there was a certain man, called <span class="person">Simon</span>, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of <span class="place">Samaria</span>, giving out that himself was some great one: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> But when they believed <span class="person">Philip</span> preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span>, they were baptized, both men and women. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Then <span class="person">Simon</span> himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with <span class="person">Philip</span>, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Now when the apostles which were at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> heard that <span class="place">Samaria</span> had received the word of God, they sent unto them <span class="person">Peter</span> and <span class="person">John</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Ghost: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> (For as yet he was fallen upon none of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span>.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And when <span class="person">Simon</span> saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given, he offered them money, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> But <span class="person">Peter</span> said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of thine heart may be forgiven thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Then answered <span class="person">Simon</span>, and said, Pray ye to the LORD for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the angel of the Lord spake unto <span class="person">Philip</span>, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> unto <span class="place">Gaza</span>, which is desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of <span class="place">Ethiopia</span>, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> for to worship, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Then the Spirit said unto <span class="person">Philip</span>, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And <span class="person">Philip</span> ran thither to him, and heard him read the prophet Esaias, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired <span class="person">Philip</span> that he would come up and sit with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And the eunuch answered <span class="person">Philip</span>, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> Then <span class="person">Philip</span> opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And as they went on their way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what doth hinder me to be baptized? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And <span class="person">Philip</span> said, If thou believest with all thine heart, thou mayest. And he answered and said, I believe that <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span> is the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both <span class="person">Philip</span> and the eunuch; and he baptized him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away <span class="person">Philip</span>, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> But <span class="person">Philip</span> was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to <span class="place">Caesarea</span>.

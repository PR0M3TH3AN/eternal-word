<h3>Chapter 21 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> <span class="person">Manasseh</span> was twelve years old when he began to reign, and reigned fifty and five years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Hephzibah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> will I put my name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he wrought much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to <span class="person">David</span>, and to <span class="person">Solomon</span> his son, In this house, and in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, which I have chosen out of all tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, will I put my name for ever: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Neither will I make the feet of <span class="place">Israel</span> move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant <span class="person">Moses</span> commanded them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> But they hearkened not: and <span class="person">Manasseh</span> seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the LORD spake by his servants the prophets, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Because <span class="person">Manasseh</span> king of <span class="person">Judah</span> hath done these abominations, and hath done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and hath made <span class="person">Judah</span> also to sin with his idols: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Behold, I am bringing such evil upon <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> and <span class="person">Judah</span>, that whosoever heareth of it, both his ears shall tingle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And I will stretch over <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> the line of <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> as a man wipeth a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And I will forsake the remnant of mine inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, even unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Moreover <span class="person">Manasseh</span> shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> from one end to another; beside his sin wherewith he made <span class="person">Judah</span> to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Now the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And <span class="person">Manasseh</span> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and <span class="person">Amon</span> his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> <span class="person">Amon</span> was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father <span class="person">Manasseh</span> did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And the servants of <span class="person">Amon</span> conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king <span class="person">Amon</span>; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Now the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Amon</span> which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And he was buried in his sepulchre in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.

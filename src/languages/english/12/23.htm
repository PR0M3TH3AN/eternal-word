<h3>Chapter 23 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the king sent, and they gathered unto him all the elders of <span class="person">Judah</span> and of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> and all the inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with him, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the people, both small and great: and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the covenant which was found in the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the king stood by a pillar, and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes with all their heart and all their soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people stood to the covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them unto <span class="place">Bethel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span> had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and in the places round about <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; them also that burned incense unto Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he brought all the priests out of the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to <span class="place">Beersheba</span>, and brake down the high places of the gates that were in the entering in of the gate of <span class="person">Joshua</span> the governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the gate of the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he took away the horses that the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span> had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span> had made, and the altars which <span class="person">Manasseh</span> had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And the high places that were before <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which <span class="person">Solomon</span> the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Moreover the altar that was at <span class="place">Bethel</span>, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and burned the grove. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God, which came from <span class="person">Judah</span>, and proclaimed these things that thou hast done against the altar of <span class="place">Bethel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came out of <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And all the houses also of the high places that were in the cities of <span class="place">Samaria</span>, which the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span> had made to provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them according to all the acts that he had done in <span class="place">Bethel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and returned to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book of this covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of the judges that judged <span class="place">Israel</span>, nor in all the days of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>, nor of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this passover was holden to the LORD in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards, and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that were spied in the land of <span class="person">Judah</span> and in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, did Josiah put away, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>; neither after him arose there any like him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against <span class="person">Judah</span>, because of all the provocations that <span class="person">Manasseh</span> had provoked him withal. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And the LORD said, I will remove <span class="person">Judah</span> also out of my sight, as I have removed <span class="place">Israel</span>, and will cast off this city <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, My name shall be there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> In his days Pharaohnechoh king of <span class="place">Egypt</span> went up against the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span> to the river <span class="place">Euphrates</span>: and king Josiah went against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo, and brought him to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and buried him in his own sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> of Libnah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of Hamath, that he might not reign in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; and put the land to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of gold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And Pharaohnechoh made <span class="person">Eliakim</span> the son of Josiah king in the room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim, and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and died there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give it unto Pharaohnechoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to reign; and he reigned eleven years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his fathers had done.

<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this side <span class="place">Jordan</span>, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite, the <span class="person"><span class="place">Canaanite</span></span>, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, heard thereof; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> That they gathered themselves together, to fight with <span class="person">Joshua</span> and with <span class="place">Israel</span>, with one accord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what <span class="person">Joshua</span> had done unto <span class="place">Jericho</span> and to Ai, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and mouldy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And they went to <span class="person">Joshua</span> unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto him, and to the men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, We be come from a far country: now therefore make ye a league with us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the men of <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they said unto <span class="person">Joshua</span>, We are thy servants. And <span class="person">Joshua</span> said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were beyond <span class="place">Jordan</span>, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey, and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants: therefore now make ye a league with us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it is dry, and it is mouldy: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and, behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are become old by reason of the very long journey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at the mouth of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had made a league with them, that they heard that they were their neighbours, and that they dwelt among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> journeyed, and came unto their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> smote them not, because the princes of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>. And all the congregation murmured against the princes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have sworn unto them by the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>: now therefore we may not touch them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation; as the princes had promised them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> called for them, and he spake unto them, saying, Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from you; when ye dwell among us? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And they answered <span class="person">Joshua</span>, and said, Because it was certainly told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his servant <span class="person">Moses</span> to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that they slew them not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD, even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

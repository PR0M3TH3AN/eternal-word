<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the second lot came forth to <span class="person">Simeon</span>, even for the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Simeon</span> according to their families: and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And they had in their inheritance <span class="place">Beersheba</span>, and <span class="person">Sheba</span>, and Moladah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their villages: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their villages: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And all the villages that were round about these cities to Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Simeon</span> according to their families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Out of the portion of the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> was the inheritance of the children of <span class="person">Simeon</span>: for the part of the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> was too much for them: therefore the children of <span class="person">Simeon</span> had their inheritance within the inheritance of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the third lot came up for the children of <span class="person">Zebulun</span> according to their families: and the border of their inheritance was unto Sarid: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before Jokneam; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and goeth up to Japhia, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher, to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon: and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And Kattath, and Nahallal, and <span class="person">Shimron</span>, and Idalah, and <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>: twelve cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> This is the inheritance of the children of <span class="person">Zebulun</span> according to their families, these cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the fourth lot came out to <span class="person">Issachar</span>, for the children of <span class="person">Issachar</span> according to their families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and Shunem, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at <span class="place">Jordan</span>: sixteen cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Issachar</span> according to their families, the cities and their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Asher</span> according to their families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to <span class="person">Zebulun</span>, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left hand, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great Zidon; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city <span class="place">Tyre</span>; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Asher</span> according to their families, these cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> The sixth lot came out to the children of <span class="person">Naphtali</span>, even for the children of <span class="person">Naphtali</span> according to their families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings thereof were at <span class="place">Jordan</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to <span class="person">Zebulun</span> on the south side, and reacheth to <span class="person">Asher</span> on the west side, and to <span class="person">Judah</span> upon <span class="place">Jordan</span> toward the sunrising. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath, and Chinnereth, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of <span class="person">Naphtali</span> according to their families, the cities and their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of <span class="place">Dan</span> according to their families. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and Irshemesh, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And <span class="person">Elon</span>, and Thimnathah, and Ekron, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And the coast of the children of <span class="place">Dan</span> went out too little for them: therefore the children of <span class="place">Dan</span> went up to fight against Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, <span class="place">Dan</span>, after the name of <span class="place">Dan</span> their father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of <span class="place">Dan</span> according to their families, these cities with their villages. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance by their coasts, the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> gave an inheritance to <span class="person">Joshua</span> the son of Nun among them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which he asked, even Timnathserah in mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: and he built the city, and dwelt therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> These are the inheritances, which <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, and <span class="person">Joshua</span> the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, divided for an inheritance by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of dividing the country.

<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then <span class="person">Joshua</span> called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And said unto them, Ye have kept all that <span class="person">Moses</span> the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day, but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren, as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which <span class="person">Moses</span> the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side <span class="place">Jordan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law, which <span class="person">Moses</span> the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> So <span class="person">Joshua</span> blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto their tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Now to the one half of the tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> <span class="person">Moses</span> had given possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave <span class="person">Joshua</span> among their brethren on this side <span class="place">Jordan</span> westward. And when <span class="person">Joshua</span> sent them away also unto their tents, then he blessed them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and the children of <span class="person">Gad</span> and the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> returned, and departed from the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> out of Shiloh, which is in the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, to go unto the country of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, to the land of their possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word of the LORD by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And when they came unto the borders of <span class="place">Jordan</span>, that are in the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and the children of <span class="person">Gad</span> and the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> built there an altar by <span class="place">Jordan</span>, a great altar to see to. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> heard say, Behold, the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and the children of <span class="person">Gad</span> and the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> have built an altar over against the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, in the borders of <span class="place">Jordan</span>, at the passage of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And when the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> heard of it, the whole congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> gathered themselves together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> sent unto the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span>, and to the children of <span class="person">Gad</span>, and to the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, into the land of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, <span class="person">Phinehas</span> the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince throughout all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and each one was an head of the house of their fathers among the thousands of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And they came unto the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span>, and to the children of <span class="person">Gad</span>, and to the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, unto the land of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, and they spake with them, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass is this that ye have committed against the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, to turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the LORD? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in the congregation of the LORD, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD? and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean, then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD, wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Did not Achan the son of <span class="person">Zerah</span> commit a trespass in the accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of <span class="place">Israel</span>? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Then the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and the children of <span class="person">Gad</span> and the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> answered, and said unto the heads of the thousands of <span class="place">Israel</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and <span class="place">Israel</span> he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing, saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> For the LORD hath made <span class="place">Jordan</span> a border between us and you, ye children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and children of <span class="person">Gad</span>; ye have no part in the LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from fearing the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices, and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but it is a witness between us and you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And when <span class="person">Phinehas</span> the priest, and the princes of the congregation and heads of the thousands of <span class="place">Israel</span> which were with him, heard the words that the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and the children of <span class="person">Gad</span> and the children of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> spake, it pleased them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And <span class="person">Phinehas</span> the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest said unto the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span>, and to the children of <span class="person">Gad</span>, and to the children of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, This day we perceive that the LORD is among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> out of the hand of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And <span class="person">Phinehas</span> the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest, and the princes, returned from the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span>, and from the children of <span class="person">Gad</span>, out of the land of <span class="place">Gilead</span>, unto the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, to the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and brought them word again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And the thing pleased the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> blessed God, and did not intend to go up against them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and <span class="person">Gad</span> dwelt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And the children of <span class="person">Reuben</span> and the children of <span class="person">Gad</span> called the altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD is God.

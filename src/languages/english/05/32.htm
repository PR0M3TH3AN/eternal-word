<h3>Chapter 32 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right is he. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and established thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy elders, and they will tell thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of <span class="person">Adam</span>, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> For the LORD's portion is his people; <span class="person">Jacob</span> is the lot of his inheritance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his eye. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young, spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations provoked they him to anger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten God that formed thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the provoking of his sons, and of his daughters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation, children in whom is no faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of gray hairs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the remembrance of them to cease from among men: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all this. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any understanding in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut them up? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> For their vine is of the vine of <span class="place">Sodom</span>, and of the fields of <span class="place">Gomorrah</span>: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my treasures? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> To me belongeth vengeance, and recompence; their foot shall slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that shall come upon them make haste. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none shut up, or left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they trusted, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> made an end of speaking all these words to all <span class="place">Israel</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to observe to do, all the words of this law. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land, whither ye go over <span class="place">Jordan</span> to possess it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> that selfsame day, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of <span class="person">Moab</span>, that is over against <span class="place">Jericho</span>; and behold the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>, which I give unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> for a possession: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto thy people; as <span class="person">Aaron</span> thy brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered unto his people: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> Because ye trespassed against me among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go thither unto the land which I give the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>.

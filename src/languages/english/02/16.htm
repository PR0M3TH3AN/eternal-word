<h3>Chapter 16 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And they took their journey from <span class="place">Elim</span>, and all the congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> came unto the wilderness of <span class="place">Sin</span>, which is between <span class="place">Elim</span> and <span class="place">Sinai</span>, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departing out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the whole congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> murmured against <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> in the wilderness: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto them, Would to God we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, when we sat by the flesh pots, and when we did eat bread to the full; for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Then said the LORD unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> said unto all the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, At even, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: and what are we, that ye murmur against us? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said, This shall be, when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: and what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> spake unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Say unto all the congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And it came to pass, as <span class="person">Aaron</span> spake unto the whole congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that they looked toward the wilderness, and, behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> I have heard the murmurings of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>: speak unto them, saying, At even ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And it came to pass, that at even the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay round about the host. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And when the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they wist not what it was. And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating, an omer for every man, according to the number of your persons; take ye every man for them which are in his tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did so, and gathered, some more, some less. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And when they did mete it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack; they gathered every man according to his eating. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto <span class="person">Moses</span>; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and stank: and <span class="person">Moses</span> was wroth with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun waxed hot, it melted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he said unto them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath unto the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which remaineth over lay up for you to be kept until the morning. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And they laid it up till the morning, as <span class="person">Moses</span> bade: and it did not stink, neither was there any worm therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said, Eat that to day; for to day is a sabbath unto the LORD: to day ye shall not find it in the field. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there shall be none. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And it came to pass, that there went out some of the people on the seventh day for to gather, and they found none. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days; abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> So the people rested on the seventh day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the house of <span class="place">Israel</span> called the name thereof Manna: and it was like coriander seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said, This is the thing which the LORD commandeth, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread wherewith I have fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> As the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>, so <span class="person">Aaron</span> laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did eat manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited; they did eat manna, until they came unto the borders of the land of <span class="place">Canaan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

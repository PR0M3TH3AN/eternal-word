<h3>Chapter 27 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> after their number, to wit, the chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and their officers that served the king in any matter of the courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of the host for the first month. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite, and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course likewise were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the Pelonite, of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the Pirathonite, of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Furthermore over the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>: the ruler of the Reubenites was <span class="person">Eliezer</span> the son of <span class="person">Zichri</span>: of the Simeonites, Shephatiah the son of <span class="person">Maachah</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of <span class="person">Kemuel</span>: of the Aaronites, Zadok: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Of <span class="person">Judah</span>, Elihu, one of the brethren of <span class="person">David</span>: of <span class="person">Issachar</span>, Omri the son of Michael: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Of <span class="person">Zebulun</span>, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of <span class="person">Naphtali</span>, Jerimoth the son of Azriel: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, Joel the son of Pedaiah: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Of the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> in <span class="place">Gilead</span>, Iddo the son of Zechariah: of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, Jaasiel the son of Abner: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Of <span class="place">Dan</span>, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> But <span class="person">David</span> took not the number of them from twenty years old and under: because the LORD had said he would increase <span class="place">Israel</span> like to the stars of the heavens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not, because there fell wrath for it against <span class="place">Israel</span>; neither was the number put in the account of the chronicles of king <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel: and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of Uzziah: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was <span class="person">Baalhanan</span> the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was Shaphat the son of Adlai: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the rulers of the substance which was king <span class="person">David</span>'s. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Also Jonathan <span class="person">David</span>'s uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the Archite was the king's companion: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.

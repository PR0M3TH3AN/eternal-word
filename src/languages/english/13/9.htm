<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> So all <span class="place">Israel</span> were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they were written in the book of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span> and <span class="person">Judah</span>, who were carried away to <span class="place">Babylon</span> for their transgression. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and the Nethinims. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> dwelt of the children of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, and of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and <span class="person">Manasseh</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Uthai the son of Ammihud, the son of Omri, the son of Imri, the son of Bani, of the children of <span class="person">Pharez</span> the son of <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And of the Shilonites; Asaiah the firstborn, and his sons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And of the sons of <span class="person">Zerah</span>; Jeuel, and their brethren, six hundred and ninety. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And of the sons of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>; Sallu the son of Meshullam, the son of Hodaviah, the son of Hasenuah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And Ibneiah the son of Jeroham, and <span class="person">Elah</span> the son of Uzzi, the son of Michri, and Meshullam the son of Shephathiah, the son of <span class="person">Reuel</span>, the son of Ibnijah; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And their brethren, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and <span class="person">Jachin</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son of Pashur, the son of Malchijah, and Maasiai the son of Adiel, the son of Jahzerah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Meshillemith, the son of Immer; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of Micah, the son of <span class="person">Zichri</span>, the son of Asaph; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of <span class="person">Asa</span>, the son of <span class="person">Elkanah</span>, that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were porters in the companies of the children of <span class="person">Levi</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of <span class="person">Korah</span>, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And <span class="person">Phinehas</span> the son of <span class="person">Eleazar</span> was the ruler over them in time past, and the LORD was with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy in their villages, whom <span class="person">David</span> and <span class="person">Samuel</span> the seer did ordain in their set office. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by wards. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west, north, and south. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come after seven days from time to time with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And they lodged round about the house of God, because the charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning pertained to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels, that they should bring them in and out by tale. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the spices. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that were made in the pans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites, were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their generations; these dwelt at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's name was <span class="person">Maachah</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and Ner, and <span class="person">Nadab</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their brethren at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, over against their brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat <span class="person">Saul</span>; and <span class="person">Saul</span> begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat Micah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea, and Ahaz. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth, and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son, Azel his son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam, Bocheru, and <span class="person">Ishmael</span>, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan: these were the sons of Azel.

<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Moreover <span class="person">David</span> and the captains of the host separated to the service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun, who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their service was: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and Nethaniah, and Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which prophesied according to the order of the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give thanks and to praise the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, <span class="person">Uzziel</span>, Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti, and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and Mahazioth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen sons and three daughters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> All these were under the hands of their father for song in the house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for the service of the house of God, according to the king's order to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> So the number of them, with their brethren that were instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as the great, the teacher as the scholar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to <span class="person">Joseph</span>: the second to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

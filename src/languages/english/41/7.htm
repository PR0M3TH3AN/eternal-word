<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, which came from <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen hands? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> He answered and said unto them, <span class="word">Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, as it is written, This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> <span class="word">Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="word">For laying aside the commandment of God, ye hold the tradition of men, as the washing of pots and cups: and many other such like things ye do.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">Full well ye reject the commandment of God, that ye may keep your own tradition.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> <span class="word">For <span class="person">Moses</span> said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and, Whoso curseth father or mother, let him die the death:</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> <span class="word">But ye say, If a man shall say to his father or mother,</span> It is Corban, that is to say, a gift, <span class="word">by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me; he shall be free.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> <span class="word">And ye suffer him no more to do ought for his father or his mother;</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> <span class="word">Making the word of God of none effect through your tradition, which ye have delivered: and many such like things do ye.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when he had called all the people unto him, he said unto them, <span class="word">Hearken unto me every one of you, and understand:</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> <span class="word">There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him: but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> <span class="word">If any man have ears to hear, let him hear. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And when he was entered into the house from the people, his disciples asked him concerning the parable. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he saith unto them, <span class="word">Are ye so without understanding also? Do ye not perceive, that whatsoever thing from without entereth into the man, it cannot defile him; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> <span class="word">Because it entereth not into his heart, but into the belly, and goeth out into the draught, purging all meats?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And he said, <span class="word">That which cometh out of the man, that defileth the man.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> <span class="word">For from within, out of the heart of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> <span class="word">Thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lasciviousness, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, foolishness: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> <span class="word">All these evil things come from within, and defile the man.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And from thence he arose, and went into the borders of <span class="place">Tyre</span> and <span class="place">Sidon</span>, and entered into an house, and would have no man know it: but he could not be hid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> For a certain woman, whose young daughter had an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell at his feet: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she besought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto her, <span class="word">Let the children first be filled: for it is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it unto the dogs.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And she answered and said unto him, Yes, Lord: yet the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And he said unto her, <span class="word">For this saying go thy way; the devil is gone out of thy daughter.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And when she was come to her house, she found the devil gone out, and her daughter laid upon the bed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And again, departing from the coasts of <span class="place">Tyre</span> and <span class="place">Sidon</span>, he came unto the sea of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, through the midst of the coasts of <span class="place">Decapolis</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And they bring unto him one that was deaf, and had an impediment in his speech; and they beseech him to put his hand upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And he took him aside from the multitude, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spit, and touched his tongue; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And looking up to heaven, he sighed, and saith unto him, <span class="word">Ephphatha,</span> that is, Be opened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And straightway his ears were opened, and the string of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man: but the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And were beyond measure astonished, saying, He hath done all things well: he maketh both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.

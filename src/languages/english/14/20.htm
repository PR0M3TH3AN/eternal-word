<h3>Chapter 20 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> It came to pass after this also, that the children of <span class="person">Moab</span>, and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on this side <span class="place">Syria</span>; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which is Engedi. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and proclaimed a fast throughout all <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Judah</span> gathered themselves together, to ask help of the LORD: even out of all the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span> they came to seek the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of <span class="person">Judah</span> and <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, in the house of the LORD, before the new court, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so that none is able to withstand thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people <span class="place">Israel</span>, and gavest it to the seed of <span class="person">Abraham</span> thy friend for ever? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary therein for thy name, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And now, behold, the children of Ammon and <span class="person">Moab</span> and mount <span class="place">Seir</span>, whom thou wouldest not let <span class="place">Israel</span> invade, when they came out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, but they turned from them, and destroyed them not; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might against this great company that cometh against us; neither know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And all <span class="person">Judah</span> stood before the LORD, with their little ones, their wives, and their children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the congregation; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And he said, Hearken ye, all <span class="person">Judah</span>, and ye inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook, before the wilderness of Jeruel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves, stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O <span class="person">Judah</span> and <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go out against them: for the LORD will be with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground: and all <span class="person">Judah</span> and the inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> fell before the LORD, worshipping the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span> with a loud voice on high. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood and said, Hear me, O <span class="person">Judah</span>, and ye inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established; believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushments against the children of Ammon, <span class="person">Moab</span>, and mount <span class="place">Seir</span>, which were come against <span class="person">Judah</span>; and they were smitten. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> For the children of Ammon and <span class="person">Moab</span> stood up against the inhabitants of mount <span class="place">Seir</span>, utterly to slay and destroy them: and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of <span class="place">Seir</span>, every one helped to destroy another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And when <span class="person">Judah</span> came toward the watch tower in the wilderness, they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah, unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Then they returned, every man of <span class="person">Judah</span> and <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their enemies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And they came to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with psalteries and harps and trumpets unto the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against the enemies of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him rest round about. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And Jehoshaphat reigned over <span class="person">Judah</span>: he was thirty and five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and five years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And he walked in the way of <span class="person">Asa</span> his father, and departed not from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And after this did Jehoshaphat king of <span class="person">Judah</span> join himself with Ahaziah king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, who did very wickedly: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to <span class="person">Tarshish</span>: and they made the ships in Eziongaber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> Then <span class="person">Eliezer</span> the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were broken, that they were not able to go to <span class="person">Tarshish</span>.

<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> <span class="person">Belshazzar</span> the king made a great feast to a thousand of his lords, and drank wine before the thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> <span class="person">Belshazzar</span>, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the golden and silver vessels which his father <span class="person">Nebuchadnezzar</span>  had taken out of the temple which was in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; that the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of the temple of the house of God which was at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; and the king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver, of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that wrote. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and his knees smote one against another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said to the wise men of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, Whosoever shall read this writing, and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then was king <span class="person">Belshazzar</span> greatly troubled, and his countenance was changed in him, and his lords were astonied. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor let thy countenance be changed: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was found in him; whom the king <span class="person">Nebuchadnezzar</span>  thy father, the king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians, astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same <span class="person">Daniel</span>, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let <span class="person">Daniel</span> be called, and he will shew the interpretation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Then was <span class="person">Daniel</span> brought in before the king. And the king spake and said unto <span class="person">Daniel</span>, Art thou that <span class="person">Daniel</span>, which art of the children of the captivity of <span class="person">Judah</span>, whom the king my father brought out of Jewry? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is found in thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in before me, that they should read this writing, and make known unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew the interpretation of the thing: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof, thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then <span class="person">Daniel</span> answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the interpretation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> O thou king, the most high God gave <span class="person">Nebuchadnezzar</span>  thy father a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he set up; and whom he would he put down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses: they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomsoever he will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And thou his son, O <span class="person">Belshazzar</span>, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou knewest all this; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing was written. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL, UPHARSIN. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finished it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found wanting. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and Persians. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Then commanded <span class="person">Belshazzar</span>, and they clothed <span class="person">Daniel</span> with scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler in the kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> In that night was <span class="person">Belshazzar</span> the king of the Chaldeans slain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And <span class="person">Darius</span> the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore and two years old.

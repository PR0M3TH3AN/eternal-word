<h3>Chapter 26 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, when <span class="person">Jesus</span> had finished all these sayings, he said unto his disciples, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> <span class="word">Ye know that after two days is the feast of the passover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Then assembled together the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the high priest, who was called <span class="person">Caiaphas</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And consulted that they might take <span class="person">Jesus</span> by subtilty, and kill him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But they said, Not on the feast day, lest there be an uproar among the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Now when <span class="person">Jesus</span> was in <span class="place">Bethany</span>, in the house of <span class="person">Simon</span> the leper, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> There came unto him a woman having an alabaster box of very precious ointment, and poured it on his head, as he sat at meat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> understood it, he said unto them, <span class="word">Why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span><span class="word"> For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> <span class="word">For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she did it for my burial. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> <span class="word">Verily I say unto you, Wheresoever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then one of the twelve, called <span class="person">Judas</span> Iscariot, went unto the chief priests, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And said unto them, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him unto you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to <span class="person">Jesus</span>, saying unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he said, <span class="word">Go into the city to such a man, and say unto him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at thy house with my disciples.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the disciples did as <span class="person">Jesus</span> had appointed them; and they made ready the passover. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Now when the even was come, he sat down with the twelve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And as they did eat, he said, <span class="word">Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of them to say unto him, Lord, is it I? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he answered and said, <span class="word">He that dippeth his hand with me in the dish, the same shall betray me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="word">The Son of man goeth as it is written of him: but woe unto that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Then <span class="person">Judas</span>, which betrayed him, answered and said, Master, is it I? He said unto him, <span class="word">Thou hast said.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And as they were eating, <span class="person">Jesus</span> took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said,<span class="word"> Take, eat; this is my body.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, <span class="word">Drink ye all of it;</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> <span class="word">For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> <span class="word">But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Then saith <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto them, <span class="word">All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> <span class="word">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into <span class="place">Galilee</span>.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> <span class="person">Peter</span> answered and said unto him, Though all men shall be offended because of thee, yet will I never be offended. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Verily I say unto thee, That this night, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="person">Peter</span> said unto him, Though I should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee. Likewise also said all the disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Then cometh <span class="person">Jesus</span> with them unto a place called <span class="place">Gethsemane</span>, and saith unto the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go and pray yonder. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And he took with him <span class="person">Peter</span> and the two sons of <span class="person">Zebedee</span>, and began to be sorrowful and very heavy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> Then saith he unto them, <span class="word">My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And he went a little farther, and fell on his face, and prayed, saying, <span class="word">O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And he cometh unto the disciples, and findeth them asleep, and saith unto <span class="person">Peter</span>, <span class="word">What, could ye not watch with me one hour?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> <span class="word">Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, <span class="word">O my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes were heavy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, <span class="word">Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> <span class="word">Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth betray me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And while he yet spake, lo, <span class="person">Judas</span>, one of the twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and elders of the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> Now he that betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he: hold him fast. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And forthwith he came to <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and said, Hail, master; and kissed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Friend, wherefore art thou come?</span> Then came they, and laid hands on <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and took him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And, behold, one of them which were with <span class="person">Jesus</span> stretched out his hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the high priest's, and smote off his ear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto him, <span class="word">Put up again thy sword into his place: for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> <span class="word">Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than twelve legions of angels? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> <span class="word">But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> In that same hour said <span class="person">Jesus</span> to the multitudes, <span class="word">Are ye come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me? I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no hold on me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> <span class="word">But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span> Then all the disciples forsook him, and fled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> And they that had laid hold on <span class="person">Jesus</span> led him away to <span class="person">Caiaphas</span> the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were assembled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> But <span class="person">Peter</span> followed him afar off unto the high priest's palace, and went in, and sat with the servants, to see the end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> Now the chief priests, and elders, and all the council, sought false witness against <span class="person">Jesus</span>, to put him to death; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> But found none: yea, though many false witnesses came, yet found they none. At the last came two false witnesses, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61</span> And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62</span> And the high priest arose, and said unto him, Answerest thou nothing? what is it which these witness against thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> held his peace. And the high priest answered and said unto him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us whether thou be the <span class="person">Christ</span>, the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto him, <span class="word">Thou hast said: nevertheless I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65</span> Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses? behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66</span> What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67</span> Then did they spit in his face, and buffeted him; and others smote him with the palms of their hands, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68</span> Saying, Prophesy unto us, thou <span class="person">Christ</span>, Who is he that smote thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69</span> Now <span class="person">Peter</span> sat without in the palace: and a damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with <span class="person">Jesus</span> of <span class="place">Galilee</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70</span> But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what thou sayest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71</span> And when he was gone out into the porch, another maid saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was also with <span class="person">Jesus</span> of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72</span> And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="73">73</span> And after a while came unto him they that stood by, and said to <span class="person">Peter</span>, Surely thou also art one of them; for thy speech bewrayeth thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="74">74</span> Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not the man. And immediately the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="75">75</span> And <span class="person">Peter</span> remembered the word of <span class="person">Jesus</span>, which said unto him, <span class="word">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> And he went out, and wept bitterly.

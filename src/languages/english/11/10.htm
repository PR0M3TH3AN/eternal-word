<h3>Chapter 10 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And when the queen of <span class="person">Sheba</span> heard of the fame of <span class="person">Solomon</span> concerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hard questions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And she came to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with a very great train, with camels that bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and when she was come to <span class="person">Solomon</span>, she communed with him of all that was in her heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> told her all her questions: there was not any thing hid from the king, which he told her not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And when the queen of <span class="person">Sheba</span> had seen all <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s wisdom, and the house that he had built, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went up unto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard in mine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes had seen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom and prosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which stand continually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set thee on the throne of <span class="place">Israel</span>: because the LORD loved <span class="place">Israel</span> for ever, therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and of spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no more such abundance of spices as these which the queen of <span class="person">Sheba</span> gave to king <span class="person">Solomon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from <span class="person">Ophir</span>, brought in from <span class="person">Ophir</span> great plenty of almug trees, and precious stones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And king <span class="person">Solomon</span> gave unto the queen of <span class="person">Sheba</span> all her desire, whatsoever she asked, beside that which <span class="person">Solomon</span> gave her of his royal bounty. So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Now the weight of gold that came to <span class="person">Solomon</span> in one year was six hundred threescore and six talents of gold, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Beside that he had of the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and of all the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And king <span class="person">Solomon</span> made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six hundred shekels of gold went to one target. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound of gold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Lebanon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And all king <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days of <span class="person">Solomon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> So king <span class="person">Solomon</span> exceeded all the kings of the earth for riches and for wisdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And all the earth sought to <span class="person">Solomon</span>, to hear his wisdom, which God had put in his heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and vessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, a rate year by year. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he had a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And the king made silver to be in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> as stones, and cedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, for abundance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> had horses brought out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and linen yarn: the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And a chariot came up and went out of <span class="place">Egypt</span> for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of <span class="place">Syria</span>, did they bring them out by their means.

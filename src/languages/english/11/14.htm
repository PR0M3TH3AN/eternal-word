<h3>Chapter 14 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguise thyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and get thee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told me that I should be king over this people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse of honey, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of the child. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyes were set by reason of his age. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam cometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus and thus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in, that she shall feign herself to be another woman. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; why feignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavy tidings. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Forasmuch as I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over my people <span class="place">Israel</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And rent the kingdom away from the house of <span class="person">David</span>, and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant <span class="person">David</span>, who kept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to do that only which was right in mine eyes; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> But hast done evil above all that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee other gods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast me behind thy back: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pisseth against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in <span class="place">Israel</span>, and will take away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh away dung, till it be all gone. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; and him that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for the LORD hath spoken it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thy feet enter into the city, the child shall die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And all <span class="place">Israel</span> shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found some good thing toward the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span> in the house of Jeroboam. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over <span class="place">Israel</span>, who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> For the LORD shall smite <span class="place">Israel</span>, as a reed is shaken in the water, and he shall root up <span class="place">Israel</span> out of this good land, which he gave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river, because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And he shall give <span class="place">Israel</span> up because of the sins of Jeroboam, who did sin, and who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: and when she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And they buried him; and all <span class="place">Israel</span> mourned for him, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah the prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years: and he slept with his fathers, and <span class="person">Nadab</span> his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And Rehoboam the son of <span class="person">Solomon</span> reigned in <span class="person">Judah</span>. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, to put his name there. And his mother's name was <span class="person">Naamah</span> an Ammonitess. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Judah</span> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above all that their fathers had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, on every high hill, and under every green tree. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And there were also sodomites in the land: and they did according to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD cast out before the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, that Shishak king of <span class="place">Egypt</span> came up against <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shields of gold which <span class="person">Solomon</span> had made. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, and committed them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which kept the door of the king's house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD, that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guard chamber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <span class="person">David</span>. And his mother's name was <span class="person">Naamah</span> an Ammonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.

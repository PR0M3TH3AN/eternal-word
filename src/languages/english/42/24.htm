<h3>Chapter 24 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came unto the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed thereabout, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said unto them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in <span class="place">Galilee</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Saying, <span class="word">The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they remembered his words, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things unto the eleven, and to all the rest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> It was <span class="person">Mary</span> <span class="person">Magdalene</span>, and Joanna, and <span class="person">Mary</span> the mother of <span class="person">James</span>, and other women that were with them, which told these things unto the apostles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then arose <span class="person">Peter</span>, and ran unto the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which was come to pass. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> about threescore furlongs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And they talked together of all these things which had happened. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, <span class="person">Jesus</span> himself drew near, and went with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> But their eyes were holden that they should not know him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said unto him, Art thou only a stranger in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and hast not known the things which are come to pass there in these days? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">What things?</span> And they said unto him, Concerning <span class="person">Jesus</span> of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>, which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed <span class="place">Israel</span>: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, which were early at the sepulchre; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, which said that he was alive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And certain of them which were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Then he said unto them, <span class="word">O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> <span class="word">Ought not <span class="person">Christ</span> to have suffered these things, and to enter into his glory? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And beginning at <span class="person">Moses</span> and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And they drew nigh unto the village, whither they went: and he made as though he would have gone further. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And it came to pass, as he sat at meat with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and brake, and gave to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And they rose up the same hour, and returned to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to <span class="person">Simon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And as they thus spake, <span class="person">Jesus</span> himself stood in the midst of them, and saith unto them, <span class="word">Peace be unto you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> But they were terrified and affrighted, and supposed that they had seen a spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> <span class="word">Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his hands and his feet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said unto them, <span class="word">Have ye here any meat?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And he took it, and did eat before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">These are the words which I spake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Then opened he their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And said unto them, <span class="word">Thus it is written, and thus it behoved <span class="person">Christ</span> to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span><span class="word"> And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> <span class="word">And ye are witnesses of these things. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> <span class="word">And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, until ye be endued with power from on high. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And he led them out as far as to <span class="place">Bethany</span>, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> And they worshipped him, and returned to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with great joy: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.

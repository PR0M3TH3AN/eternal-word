<h3>Chapter 23 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him unto <span class="person">Pilate</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to <span class="person">Caesar</span>, saying that he himself is <span class="person">Christ</span> a King. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, <span class="word">Thou sayest it. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Then said <span class="person">Pilate</span> to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from <span class="place">Galilee</span> to this place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> When <span class="person">Pilate</span> heard of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And as soon as he knew that he belonged unto <span class="person">Herod</span>'s jurisdiction, he sent him to <span class="person">Herod</span>, who himself also was at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> at that time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And when <span class="person">Herod</span> saw <span class="person">Jesus</span>, he was exceeding glad: for he was desirous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to have seen some miracle done by him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And <span class="person">Herod</span> with his men of war set him at nought, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to <span class="person">Pilate</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the same day <span class="person">Pilate</span> and <span class="person">Herod</span> were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span>, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Said unto them, Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof ye accuse him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> No, nor yet <span class="person">Herod</span>: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> I will therefore chastise him, and release him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> (For of necessity he must release one unto them at the feast.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release unto us <span class="person">Barabbas</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> (Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> therefore, willing to release <span class="person">Jesus</span>, spake again to them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And he said unto them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And they were instant with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> gave sentence that it should be as they required. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And he released unto them him that for sedition and murder was cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered <span class="person">Jesus</span> to their will. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one <span class="person">Simon</span>, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, which also bewailed and lamented him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> turning unto them said, <span class="word">Daughters of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> <span class="word">For, behold, the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> <span class="word">Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span><span class="word"> For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And there were also two other, malefactors, led with him to be put to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And when they were come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span>, <span class="word">Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them derided him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he be <span class="person">Christ</span>, the chosen of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And saying, If thou be the king of the Jews, save thyself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou be <span class="person">Christ</span>, save thyself and us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And he said unto <span class="person">Jesus</span>, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Verily I say unto thee, To day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And when <span class="person">Jesus</span> had cried with a loud voice, he said, <span class="word">Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: </span>and having said thus, he gave up the ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from <span class="place">Galilee</span>, stood afar off, beholding these things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And, behold, there was a man named <span class="person">Joseph</span>, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> (The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of <span class="place">Arimathaea</span>, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> This man went unto <span class="person">Pilate</span>, and begged the body of <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, wherein never man before was laid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> And the women also, which came with him from <span class="place">Galilee</span>, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested the sabbath day according to the commandment.

<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And he spake a parable unto them to this end, that men ought always to pray, and not to faint; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Saying, <span class="word">There was in a city a judge, which feared not God, neither regarded man:</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> <span class="word">And there was a widow in that city; and she came unto him, saying, Avenge me of mine adversary. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> <span class="word">And he would not for a while: but afterward he said within himself, Though I fear not God, nor regard man; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span><span class="word"> Yet because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the Lord said,<span class="word"> Hear what the unjust judge saith. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> <span class="word">And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry day and night unto him, though he bear long with them? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="word">I tell you that he will avenge them speedily. Nevertheless when the Son of man cometh, shall he find faith on the earth? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And he spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> <span class="word">Two men went up into the temple to pray; the one a Pharisee, and the other a publican. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> <span class="word">The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank thee, that I am not as other men are, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> <span class="word">I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I possess. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> <span class="word">And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> <span class="word">I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And they brought unto him also infants, that he would touch them: but when his disciples saw it, they rebuked them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> called them unto him, and said, <span class="word">Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span><span class="word"> Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child shall in no wise enter therein. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Why callest thou me good? none is good, save one, that is, God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> <span class="word">Thou knowest the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honour thy father and thy mother. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he said, All these have I kept from my youth up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Now when <span class="person">Jesus</span> heard these things, he said unto him, <span class="word">Yet lackest thou one thing: sell all that thou hast, and distribute unto the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, follow me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And when he heard this, he was very sorrowful: for he was very rich. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And when <span class="person">Jesus</span> saw that he was very sorrowful, he said, <span class="word">How hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> <span class="word">For it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And they that heard it said, Who then can be saved? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he said, <span class="word">The things which are impossible with men are possible with God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Then <span class="person">Peter</span> said, Lo, we have left all, and followed thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">Verily I say unto you, There is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of God's sake, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> <span class="word">Who shall not receive manifold more in this present time, and in the world to come life everlasting. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Then he took unto him the twelve, and said unto them, <span class="word">Behold, we go up to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> <span class="word">For he shall be delivered unto the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and spitefully entreated, and spitted on: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span><span class="word"> And they shall scourge him, and put him to death: and the third day he shall rise again. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And they understood none of these things: and this saying was hid from them, neither knew they the things which were spoken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And it came to pass, that as he was come nigh unto <span class="place">Jericho</span>, a certain blind man sat by the way side begging: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And hearing the multitude pass by, he asked what it meant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And they told him, that <span class="person">Jesus</span> of <span class="place">Nazareth</span> passeth by. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And he cried, saying, <span class="person">Jesus</span>, thou son of <span class="person">David</span>, have mercy on me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And they which went before rebuked him, that he should hold his peace: but he cried so much the more, Thou son of <span class="person">David</span>, have mercy on me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> stood, and commanded him to be brought unto him: and when he was come near, he asked him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Saying, <span class="word">What wilt thou that I shall do unto thee? </span>And he said, Lord, that I may receive my sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Receive thy sight: thy faith hath saved thee. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God: and all the people, when they saw it, gave praise unto God.

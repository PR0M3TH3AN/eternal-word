<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh, which is called the Passover. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the chief priests and scribes sought how they might kill him; for they feared the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Then entered <span class="person">Satan</span> into <span class="person">Judas</span> surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And he went his way, and communed with the chief priests and captains, how he might betray him unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they were glad, and covenanted to give him money. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he promised, and sought opportunity to betray him unto them in the absence of the multitude. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then came the day of unleavened bread, when the passover must be killed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he sent <span class="person">Peter</span> and <span class="person">John</span>, saying, <span class="word">Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And they said unto him, Where wilt thou that we prepare? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you, bearing a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he entereth in. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span><span class="word"> And ye shall say unto the goodman of the house, The Master saith unto thee, Where is the guestchamber, where I shall eat the passover with my disciples? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> <span class="word">And he shall shew you a large upper room furnished: there make ready. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And they went, and found as he had said unto them: and they made ready the passover. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when the hour was come, he sat down, and the twelve apostles with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">With desire I have desired to eat this passover with you before I suffer: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> <span class="word">For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof, until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he took the cup, <span class="word">and gave thanks, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> <span class="word">For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of God shall come. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And he took bread, and gave thanks, and brake it, and gave unto them, saying, <span class="word">This is my body which is given for you: this do in remembrance of me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, <span class="word">This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span><span class="word"> But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me on the table. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span><span class="word"> And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man by whom he is betrayed! </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And they began to enquire among themselves, which of them it was that should do this thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And there was also a strife among them, which of them should be accounted the greatest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them are called benefactors. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> <span class="word">But ye shall not be so: but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> <span class="word">For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> <span class="word">Ye are they which have continued with me in my temptations. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span><span class="word"> And I appoint unto you a kingdom, as my Father hath appointed unto me; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span><span class="word"> That ye may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom, and sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the Lord said, <span class="word"><span class="person">Simon</span>, <span class="person">Simon</span>, behold, <span class="person">Satan</span> hath desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span><span class="word"> But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not: and when thou art converted, strengthen thy brethren. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And he said unto him, Lord, I am ready to go with thee, both into prison, and to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And he said, <span class="word">I tell thee, <span class="person">Peter</span>, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">When I sent you without purse, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? </span>And they said, Nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Then said he unto them,<span class="word"> But now, he that hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise his scrip: and he that hath no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> <span class="word">For I say unto you, that this that is written must yet be accomplished in me, And he was reckoned among the transgressors: for the things concerning me have an end. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And they said, Lord, behold, here are two swords. And he said unto them, <span class="word">It is enough.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And he came out, and went, as he was wont, to the mount of Olives; and his disciples also followed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And when he was at the place, he said unto them, <span class="word">Pray that ye enter not into temptation.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And he was withdrawn from them about a stone's cast, and kneeled down, and prayed, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> Saying, <span class="word">Father, if thou be willing, remove this cup from me: nevertheless not my will, but thine, be done.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And there appeared an angel unto him from heaven, strengthening him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And being in an agony he prayed more earnestly: and his sweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And when he rose up from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he found them sleeping for sorrow, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And said unto them, <span class="word">Why sleep ye? rise and pray, lest ye enter into temptation. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And while he yet spake, behold a multitude, and he that was called <span class="person">Judas</span>, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near unto <span class="person">Jesus</span> to kiss him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word"><span class="person">Judas</span>, betrayest thou the Son of man with a kiss?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said unto him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And one of them smote the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered and said, <span class="word">Suffer ye thus far. </span>And he touched his ear, and healed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Then <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto the chief priests, and captains of the temple, and the elders, which were come to him, <span class="word">Be ye come out, as against a thief, with swords and staves? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> <span class="word">When I was daily with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no hands against me: but this is your hour, and the power of darkness. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> Then took they him, and led him, and brought him into the high priest's house. And <span class="person">Peter</span> followed afar off. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> And when they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were set down together, <span class="person">Peter</span> sat down among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> But a certain maid beheld him as he sat by the fire, and earnestly looked upon him, and said, This man was also with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> And he denied him, saying, Woman, I know him not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> And after a little while another saw him, and said, Thou art also of them. And <span class="person">Peter</span> said, Man, I am not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> And about the space of one hour after another confidently affirmed, saying, Of a truth this fellow also was with him: for he is a Galilaean. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> And <span class="person">Peter</span> said, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And immediately, while he yet spake, the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61</span> And the Lord turned, and looked upon <span class="person">Peter</span>. And <span class="person">Peter</span> remembered the word of the Lord, how he had said unto him, <span class="word">Before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62</span> And <span class="person">Peter</span> went out, and wept bitterly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63</span> And the men that held <span class="person">Jesus</span> mocked him, and smote him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64</span> And when they had blindfolded him, they struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Prophesy, who is it that smote thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65</span> And many other things blasphemously spake they against him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66</span> And as soon as it was day, the elders of the people and the chief priests and the scribes came together, and led him into their council, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67</span> Art thou the <span class="person">Christ</span>? tell us. And he said unto them, <span class="word">If I tell you, ye will not believe: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68</span> <span class="word">And if I also ask you, ye will not answer me, nor let me go. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69</span> <span class="word">Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70</span> Then said they all, Art thou then the Son of God? And he said unto them, <span class="word">Ye say that I am.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71</span> And they said, What need we any further witness? for we ourselves have heard of his own mouth.

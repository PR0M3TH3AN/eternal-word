<h3>Chapter 24 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And <span class="person">Abraham</span> was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed <span class="person">Abraham</span> in all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And <span class="person">Abraham</span> said unto his eldest servant of his house, that ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son <span class="person">Isaac</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy son again unto the land from whence thou camest? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Abraham</span> said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my son thither again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house, and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my son from thence. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son thither again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of <span class="person">Abraham</span> his master, and sware to him concerning that matter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to <span class="place">Mesopotamia</span>, unto the city of <span class="person">Nahor</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that women go out to draw water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And he said, O LORD God of my master <span class="person">Abraham</span>, I pray thee, send me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master <span class="person">Abraham</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters of the men of the city come out to draw water: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say, Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant <span class="person">Isaac</span>; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness unto my master. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that, behold, <span class="person">Rebekah</span> came out, who was born to <span class="person">Bethuel</span>, son of <span class="person">Milcah</span>, the wife of <span class="person">Nahor</span>, <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s brother, with her pitcher upon her shoulder. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and filled her pitcher, and came up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his camels. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of <span class="person">Bethuel</span> the son of <span class="person">Milcah</span>, which she bare unto <span class="person">Nahor</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender enough, and room to lodge in. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master <span class="person">Abraham</span>, who hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth: I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my master's brethren.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> had a brother, and his name was <span class="person">Laban</span>: and <span class="person">Laban</span> ran out unto the man, unto the well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of <span class="person">Rebekah</span> his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at the well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room for the camels.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels, and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash his feet, and the men's feet that were with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And he said, I am <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s servant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver, and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and asses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And <span class="person">Sarah</span> my master's wife bare a son to my master when she was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I dwell: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred, and take a wife unto my son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not follow me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be clear from my oath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my master <span class="person">Abraham</span>, if now thou do prosper my way which I go: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy pitcher to drink; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath appointed out for my master's son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, <span class="person">Rebekah</span> came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me drink, I pray thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she said, The daughter of <span class="person">Bethuel</span>, <span class="person">Nahor</span>'s son, whom <span class="person">Milcah</span> bare unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the bracelets upon her hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed the LORD God of my master <span class="person">Abraham</span>, which had led me in the right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or to the left.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> Then <span class="person">Laban</span> and <span class="person">Bethuel</span> answered and said, The thing proceedeth from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> Behold, <span class="person">Rebekah</span> is before thee, take her, and go, and let her be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> And it came to pass, that, when <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s servant heard their words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment, and gave them to <span class="person">Rebekah</span>: he gave also to her brother and to her mother precious things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him, and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he said, Send me away unto my master. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> And they called <span class="person">Rebekah</span>, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with this man? And she said, I will go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> And they sent away <span class="person">Rebekah</span> their sister, and her nurse, and <span class="person">Abraham</span>'s servant, and his men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> And they blessed <span class="person">Rebekah</span>, and said unto her, Thou art our sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the camels, and followed the man: and the servant took <span class="person">Rebekah</span>, and went his way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt in the south country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> went out to meditate in the field at the eventide: and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels were coming. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> lifted up her eyes, and when she saw <span class="person">Isaac</span>, she lighted off the camel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65</span> For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66</span> And the servant told <span class="person">Isaac</span> all things that he had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> brought her into his mother <span class="person">Sarah</span>'s tent, and took <span class="person">Rebekah</span>, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and <span class="person">Isaac</span> was comforted after his mother's death.

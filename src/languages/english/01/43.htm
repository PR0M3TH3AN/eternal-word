<h3>Chapter 43</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the famine was sore in the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, their father said unto them, Go again, buy us a little food. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Judah</span> spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy thee food: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother be with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="place">Israel</span> said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell the man whether ye had yet a brother? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your brother down? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Judah</span> said unto <span class="place">Israel</span> his father, Send the lad with me, and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both we, and thou, and also our little ones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him: if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then let me bear the blame for ever: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this second time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And their father <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And take double money in your hand; and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in your hand; peradventure it was an oversight: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may send away your other brother, and <span class="person">Benjamin</span>. If I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the men took that present, and they took double money in their hand, and <span class="person">Benjamin</span>; and rose up, and went down to <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and stood before <span class="person">Joseph</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And when <span class="person">Joseph</span> saw <span class="person">Benjamin</span> with them, he said to the ruler of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready; for these men shall dine with me at noon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the man did as <span class="person">Joseph</span> bade; and the man brought the men into <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s house; and they said, Because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in; that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and take us for bondmen, and our asses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And they came near to the steward of <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s house, and they communed with him at the door of the house, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy food: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it again in our hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food: we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had your money. And he brought <span class="person">Simeon</span> out unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the man brought the men into <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s house, and gave them water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses provender. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they made ready the present against <span class="person">Joseph</span> came at noon: for they heard that they should eat bread there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And when <span class="person">Joseph</span> came home, they brought him the present which was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him to the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health, he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made obeisance.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, his mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his chamber, and wept there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself, and said, Set on bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the men marvelled one at another. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but <span class="person">Benjamin</span>'s mess was five times so much as any of theirs. And they drank, and were merry with him.

<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And when <span class="person">Rachel</span> saw that she bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> no children, <span class="person">Rachel</span> envied her sister; and said unto <span class="person">Jacob</span>, Give me children, or else I die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s anger was kindled against <span class="person">Rachel</span>: and he said, Am I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the womb? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And she said, Behold my maid <span class="person">Bilhah</span>, go in unto her; and she shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And she gave him <span class="person">Bilhah</span> her handmaid to wife: and <span class="person">Jacob</span> went in unto her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And <span class="person">Bilhah</span> conceived, and bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> a son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Rachel</span> said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name <span class="place">Dan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And <span class="person">Bilhah</span> <span class="person">Rachel</span>'s maid conceived again, and bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> a second son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Rachel</span> said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name <span class="person">Naphtali</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> When <span class="person">Leah</span> saw that she had left bearing, she took <span class="person">Zilpah</span> her maid, and gave her <span class="person">Jacob</span> to wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And <span class="person">Zilpah</span> <span class="person">Leah</span>'s maid bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> a son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And <span class="person">Leah</span> said, A troop cometh: and she called his name <span class="person">Gad</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And <span class="person">Zilpah</span> <span class="person">Leah</span>'s maid bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> a second son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And <span class="person">Leah</span> said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me blessed: and she called his name <span class="person">Asher</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And <span class="person">Reuben</span> went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother <span class="person">Leah</span>. Then <span class="person">Rachel</span> said to <span class="person">Leah</span>, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's mandrakes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's mandrakes also? And <span class="person">Rachel</span> said, Therefore he shall lie with thee to night for thy son's mandrakes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span> came out of the field in the evening, and <span class="person">Leah</span> went out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay with her that night. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And God hearkened unto <span class="person">Leah</span>, and she conceived, and bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> the fifth son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And <span class="person">Leah</span> said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given my maiden to my husband: and she called his name <span class="person">Issachar</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Leah</span> conceived again, and bare <span class="person">Jacob</span> the sixth son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And <span class="person">Leah</span> said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons: and she called his name <span class="person">Zebulun</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name <span class="person">Dinah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And God remembered <span class="person">Rachel</span>, and God hearkened to her, and opened her womb. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken away my reproach: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And she called his name <span class="person">Joseph</span>; and said, The LORD shall add to me another son.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And it came to pass, when <span class="person">Rachel</span> had born <span class="person">Joseph</span>, that <span class="person">Jacob</span> said unto <span class="person">Laban</span>, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own place, and to my country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee, and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And <span class="person">Laban</span> said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and how thy cattle was with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own house also? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he said, What shall I give thee? And <span class="person">Jacob</span> said, Thou shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for me, I will again feed and keep thy flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats: and of such shall be my hire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And <span class="person">Laban</span> said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy word. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted, and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and <span class="person">Jacob</span>: and <span class="person">Jacob</span> fed the rest of <span class="person">Laban</span>'s flocks.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span> took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which was in the rods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span> did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock of <span class="person">Laban</span>; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put them not unto <span class="person">Laban</span>'s cattle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did conceive, that <span class="person">Jacob</span> laid the rods before the eyes of the cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the feebler were <span class="person">Laban</span>'s, and the stronger <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.

<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and shall encamp round about the tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did according to all that the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>, so did they.

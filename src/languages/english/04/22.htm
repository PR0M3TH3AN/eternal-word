<h3>Chapter 22 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> set forward, and pitched in the plains of <span class="person">Moab</span> on this side <span class="place">Jordan</span> by <span class="place">Jericho</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that <span class="place">Israel</span> had done to the Amorites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Moab</span> was sore afraid of the people, because they were many: and <span class="person">Moab</span> was distressed because of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Moab</span> said unto the elders of <span class="person">Midian</span>, Now shall this company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of <span class="person">Beor</span> to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from <span class="place">Egypt</span>: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the elders of <span class="person">Moab</span> and the elders of <span class="person">Midian</span> departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the princes of <span class="person">Moab</span> abode with Balaam. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of <span class="person">Moab</span>, hath sent unto me, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Behold, there is a people come out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the princes of <span class="person">Moab</span> rose up, and they went unto Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable than they. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say unto me more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of <span class="person">Moab</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him unto a city of <span class="person">Moab</span>, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost coast. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honour? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes that were with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see the utmost part of the people.

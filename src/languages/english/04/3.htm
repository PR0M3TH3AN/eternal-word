<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> These also are the generations of <span class="person">Aaron</span> and <span class="person">Moses</span> in the day that the LORD spake with <span class="person">Moses</span> in mount <span class="place">Sinai</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And these are the names of the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span>; <span class="person">Nadab</span> the firstborn, and <span class="person">Abihu</span>, <span class="person">Eleazar</span>, and <span class="person">Ithamar</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> These are the names of the sons of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, the priests which were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's office. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Nadab</span> and <span class="person">Abihu</span> died before the LORD, when they offered strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>, and they had no children: and <span class="person">Eleazar</span> and <span class="person">Ithamar</span> ministered in the priest's office in the sight of <span class="person">Aaron</span> their father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Bring the tribe of <span class="person">Levi</span> near, and present them before <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest, that they may minister unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do the service of the tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of the congregation, and the charge of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, to do the service of the tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And thou shalt give the Levites unto <span class="person">Aaron</span> and to his sons: they are wholly given unto him out of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And thou shalt appoint <span class="person">Aaron</span> and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> instead of all the firstborn that openeth the matrix among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>: therefore the Levites shall be mine; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I smote all the firstborn in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> I hallowed unto me all the firstborn in <span class="place">Israel</span>, both man and beast: mine shall they be: I am the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> in the wilderness of <span class="place">Sinai</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Number the children of <span class="person">Levi</span> after the house of their fathers, by their families: every male from a month old and upward shalt thou number them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as he was commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And these were the sons of <span class="person">Levi</span> by their names; <span class="person">Gershon</span>, and <span class="person">Kohath</span>, and <span class="person">Merari</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And these are the names of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span> by their families; <span class="person">Libni</span>, and Shimei. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> by their families; <span class="person">Amram</span>, and Izehar, <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>, and <span class="person">Uzziel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span> by their families; Mahli, and <span class="person">Mushi</span>. These are the families of the Levites according to the house of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Of <span class="person">Gershon</span> was the family of the Libnites, and the family of the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the tabernacle westward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the charge of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And of <span class="person">Kohath</span> was the family of the Amramites, and the family of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the Kohathites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the sanctuary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> The families of the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle southward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And the chief of the house of the father of the families of the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of <span class="person">Uzziel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Of <span class="person">Merari</span> was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of the Mushites: these are the families of <span class="person">Merari</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And those that were numbered of them, according to the number of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six thousand and two hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the chief of the house of the father of the families of <span class="person">Merari</span> was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the side of the tabernacle northward. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And under the custody and charge of the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span> shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels thereof, and all that serveth thereto, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east, even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall be <span class="person">Moses</span>, and <span class="person">Aaron</span> and his sons, keeping the charge of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> All that were numbered of the Levites, which <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their families, all the males from a month old and upward, were twenty and two thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Number all the firstborn of the males of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> from a month old and upward, and take the number of their names. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead of all the firstborn among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and the cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the cattle of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the firstborn among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them, were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and thirteen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, which are more than the Levites; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel is twenty gerahs:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of them is to be redeemed, unto <span class="person">Aaron</span> and to his sons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> took the redemption money of them that were over and above them that were redeemed by the Levites: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> Of the firstborn of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> took he the money; a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> gave the money of them that were redeemed unto <span class="person">Aaron</span> and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded <span class="person">Moses</span>.

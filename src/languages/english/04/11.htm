<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the people cried unto <span class="person">Moses</span>; and when <span class="person">Moses</span> prayed unto the LORD, the fire was quenched. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> We remember the fish, which we did eat in <span class="place">Egypt</span> freely; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlick: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this manna, before our eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as the colour of bdellium. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Then <span class="person">Moses</span> heard the people weep throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly; <span class="person">Moses</span> also was displeased. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which thou swarest unto their fathers? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Gather unto me seventy men of the elders of <span class="place">Israel</span>, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not thyself alone. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in <span class="place">Egypt</span>: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of <span class="place">Egypt</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to suffice them? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Is the LORD's hand waxed short? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee or not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And there ran a young man, and told <span class="person">Moses</span>, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And <span class="person">Joshua</span> the son of Nun, the servant of <span class="person">Moses</span>, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord <span class="person">Moses</span>, forbid them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> gat him into the camp, he and the elders of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves round about the camp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth; and abode at Hazeroth.

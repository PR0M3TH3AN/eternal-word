<h3>Chapter 50</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> The word that the LORD spake against <span class="place">Babylon</span> and against the land of the Chaldeans by <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> the prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Declare ye among the nations, and publish, and set up a standard; publish, and conceal not: say, <span class="place">Babylon</span> is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is broken in pieces; her idols are confounded, her images are broken in pieces. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> For out of the north there cometh up a nation against her, which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein: they shall remove, they shall depart, both man and beast. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> shall come, they and the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> together, going and weeping: they shall go, and seek the LORD their God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> They shall ask the way to Zion with their faces thitherward, saying, Come, and let us join ourselves to the LORD in a perpetual covenant that shall not be forgotten. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> My people hath been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have turned them away on the mountains: they have gone from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their restingplace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> All that found them have devoured them: and their adversaries said, We offend not, because they have sinned against the LORD, the habitation of justice, even the LORD, the hope of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Remove out of the midst of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldeans, and be as the he goats before the flocks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> For, lo, I will raise and cause to come up against <span class="place">Babylon</span> an assembly of great nations from the north country: and they shall set themselves in array against her; from thence she shall be taken: their arrows shall be as of a mighty expert man; none shall return in vain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Because ye were glad, because ye rejoiced, O ye destroyers of mine heritage, because ye are grown fat as the heifer at grass, and bellow as bulls; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Your mother shall be sore confounded; she that bare you shall be ashamed: behold, the hindermost of the nations shall be a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Because of the wrath of the LORD it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be wholly desolate: every one that goeth by <span class="place">Babylon</span> shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Put yourselves in array against <span class="place">Babylon</span> round about: all ye that bend the bow, shoot at her, spare no arrows: for she hath sinned against the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Shout against her round about: she hath given her hand: her foundations are fallen, her walls are thrown down: for it is the vengeance of the LORD: take vengeance upon her; as she hath done, do unto her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Cut off the sower from <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and him that handleth the sickle in the time of harvest: for fear of the oppressing sword they shall turn every one to his people, and they shall flee every one to his own land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> <span class="place">Israel</span> is a scattered sheep; the lions have driven him away: first the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span> hath devoured him; and last this Nebuchadrezzar king of <span class="place">Babylon</span> hath broken his bones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>; Behold, I will punish the king of <span class="place">Babylon</span> and his land, as I have punished the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And I will bring <span class="place">Israel</span> again to his habitation, and he shall feed on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied upon mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span> and <span class="place">Gilead</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> In those days, and in that time, saith the LORD, the iniquity of <span class="place">Israel</span> shall be sought for, and there shall be none; and the sins of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and they shall not be found: for I will pardon them whom I reserve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against the inhabitants of Pekod: waste and utterly destroy after them, saith the LORD, and do according to all that I have commanded thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> How is the hammer of the whole earth cut asunder and broken! how is <span class="place">Babylon</span> become a desolation among the nations! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> I have laid a snare for thee, and thou art also taken, O <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and thou wast not aware: thou art found, and also caught, because thou hast striven against the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> The LORD hath opened his armoury, and hath brought forth the weapons of his indignation: for this is the work of the Lord GOD of hosts in the land of the Chaldeans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Come against her from the utmost border, open her storehouses: cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly: let nothing of her be left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Slay all her bullocks; let them go down to the slaughter: woe unto them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> The voice of them that flee and escape out of the land of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, to declare in Zion the vengeance of the LORD our God, the vengeance of his temple. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Call together the archers against <span class="place">Babylon</span>: all ye that bend the bow, camp against it round about; let none thereof escape: recompense her according to her work; according to all that she hath done, do unto her: for she hath been proud against the LORD, against the Holy One of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Therefore shall her young men fall in the streets, and all her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Behold, I am against thee, O thou most proud, saith the Lord GOD of hosts: for thy day is come, the time that I will visit thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the most proud shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all round about him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The children of <span class="place">Israel</span> and the children of <span class="person">Judah</span> were oppressed together: and all that took them captives held them fast; they refused to let them go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Their Redeemer is strong; the LORD of hosts is his name: he shall throughly plead their cause, that he may give rest to the land, and disquiet the inhabitants of <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> A sword is upon the Chaldeans, saith the LORD, and upon the inhabitants of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and upon her princes, and upon her wise men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> A sword is upon the liars; and they shall dote: a sword is upon her mighty men; and they shall be dismayed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> A sword is upon their horses, and upon their chariots, and upon all the mingled people that are in the midst of her; and they shall become as women: a sword is upon her treasures; and they shall be robbed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> A drought is upon her waters; and they shall be dried up: for it is the land of graven images, and they are mad upon their idols. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> Therefore the wild beasts of the desert with the wild beasts of the islands shall dwell there, and the owls shall dwell therein: and it shall be no more inhabited for ever; neither shall it be dwelt in from generation to generation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> As God overthrew <span class="place">Sodom</span> and <span class="place">Gomorrah</span> and the neighbour cities thereof, saith the LORD; so shall no man abide there, neither shall any son of man dwell therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Behold, a people shall come from the north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be raised up from the coasts of the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> They shall hold the bow and the lance: they are cruel, and will not shew mercy: their voice shall roar like the sea, and they shall ride upon horses, every one put in array, like a man to the battle, against thee, O daughter of <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> The king of <span class="place">Babylon</span> hath heard the report of them, and his hands waxed feeble: anguish took hold of him, and pangs as of a woman in travail. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the swelling of <span class="place">Jordan</span> unto the habitation of the strong: but I will make them suddenly run away from her: and who is a chosen man, that I may appoint over her? for who is like me? and who will appoint me the time? and who is that shepherd that will stand before me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Therefore hear ye the counsel of the LORD, that he hath taken against <span class="place">Babylon</span>; and his purposes, that he hath purposed against the land of the Chaldeans: Surely the least of the flock shall draw them out: surely he shall make their habitation desolate with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> At the noise of the taking of <span class="place">Babylon</span> the earth is moved, and the cry is heard among the nations.

<h3>Chapter 51</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will raise up against <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and against them that dwell in the midst of them that rise up against me, a destroying wind; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And will send unto <span class="place">Babylon</span> fanners, that shall fan her, and shall empty her land: for in the day of trouble they shall be against her round about. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Against him that bendeth let the archer bend his bow, and against him that lifteth himself up in his brigandine: and spare ye not her young men; destroy ye utterly all her host. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Thus the slain shall fall in the land of the Chaldeans, and they that are thrust through in her streets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> For <span class="place">Israel</span> hath not been forsaken, nor <span class="person">Judah</span> of his God, of the LORD of hosts; though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Flee out of the midst of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and deliver every man his soul: be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance; he will render unto her a recompence. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> <span class="place">Babylon</span> hath been a golden cup in the LORD's hand, that made all the earth drunken: the nations have drunken of her wine; therefore the nations are mad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="place">Babylon</span> is suddenly fallen and destroyed: howl for her; take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> We would have healed <span class="place">Babylon</span>, but she is not healed: forsake her, and let us go every one into his own country: for her judgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the skies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> The LORD hath brought forth our righteousness: come, and let us declare in Zion the work of the LORD our God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Make bright the arrows; gather the shields: the LORD hath raised up the spirit of the kings of the Medes: for his device is against <span class="place">Babylon</span>, to destroy it; because it is the vengeance of the LORD, the vengeance of his temple. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Set up the standard upon the walls of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, make the watch strong, set up the watchmen, prepare the ambushes: for the LORD hath both devised and done that which he spake against the inhabitants of <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> O thou that dwellest upon many waters, abundant in treasures, thine end is come, and the measure of thy covetousness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> The LORD of hosts hath sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill thee with men, as with caterpillers; and they shall lift up a shout against thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heaven by his understanding. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> When he uttereth his voice, there is a multitude of waters in the heavens; and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth: he maketh lightnings with rain, and bringeth forth the wind out of his treasures. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Every man is brutish by his knowledge; every founder is confounded by the graven image: for his molten image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> They are vanity, the work of errors: in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The portion of <span class="person">Jacob</span> is not like them; for he is the former of all things: and <span class="place">Israel</span> is the rod of his inheritance: the LORD of hosts is his name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Thou art my battle axe and weapons of war: for with thee will I break in pieces the nations, and with thee will I destroy kingdoms; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And with thee will I break in pieces the horse and his rider; and with thee will I break in pieces the chariot and his rider; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> With thee also will I break in pieces man and woman; and with thee will I break in pieces old and young; and with thee will I break in pieces the young man and the maid; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> I will also break in pieces with thee the shepherd and his flock; and with thee will I break in pieces the husbandman and his yoke of oxen; and with thee will I break in pieces captains and rulers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And I will render unto <span class="place">Babylon</span> and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Behold, I am against thee, O destroying mountain, saith the LORD, which destroyest all the earth: and I will stretch out mine hand upon thee, and roll thee down from the rocks, and will make thee a burnt mountain. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And they shall not take of thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for foundations; but thou shalt be desolate for ever, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Prepare against her the nations with the kings of the Medes, the captains thereof, and all the rulers thereof, and all the land of his dominion. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against <span class="place">Babylon</span>, to make the land of <span class="place">Babylon</span> a desolation without an inhabitant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> The mighty men of <span class="place">Babylon</span> have forborn to fight, they have remained in their holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to shew the king of <span class="place">Babylon</span> that his city is taken at one end, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And that the passages are stopped, and the reeds they have burned with fire, and the men of war are affrighted. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>; The daughter of <span class="place">Babylon</span> is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Nebuchadrezzar the king of <span class="place">Babylon</span> hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, he hath cast me out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> The violence done to me and to my flesh be upon <span class="place">Babylon</span>, shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and my blood upon the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> say. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will plead thy cause, and take vengeance for thee; and I will dry up her sea, and make her springs dry. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And <span class="place">Babylon</span> shall become heaps, a dwellingplace for dragons, an astonishment, and an hissing, without an inhabitant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> They shall roar together like lions: they shall yell as lions' whelps. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> In their heat I will make their feasts, and I will make them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams with he goats. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> How is Sheshach taken! and how is the praise of the whole earth surprised! how is <span class="place">Babylon</span> become an astonishment among the nations! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> The sea is come up upon <span class="place">Babylon</span>: she is covered with the multitude of the waves thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> Her cities are a desolation, a dry land, and a wilderness, a land wherein no man dwelleth, neither doth any son of man pass thereby. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And I will punish Bel in <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and I will bring forth out of his mouth that which he hath swallowed up: and the nations shall not flow together any more unto him: yea, the wall of <span class="place">Babylon</span> shall fall. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> My people, go ye out of the midst of her, and deliver ye every man his soul from the fierce anger of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And lest your heart faint, and ye fear for the rumour that shall be heard in the land; a rumour shall both come one year, and after that in another year shall come a rumour, and violence in the land, ruler against ruler. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will do judgment upon the graven images of <span class="place">Babylon</span>: and her whole land shall be confounded, and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> Then the heaven and the earth, and all that is therein, shall sing for <span class="place">Babylon</span>: for the spoilers shall come unto her from the north, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> As <span class="place">Babylon</span> hath caused the slain of <span class="place">Israel</span> to fall, so at <span class="place">Babylon</span> shall fall the slain of all the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> Ye that have escaped the sword, go away, stand not still: remember the LORD afar off, and let <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> come into your mind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> We are confounded, because we have heard reproach: shame hath covered our faces: for strangers are come into the sanctuaries of the LORD's house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Wherefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will do judgment upon her graven images: and through all her land the wounded shall groan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> Though <span class="place">Babylon</span> should mount up to heaven, and though she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall spoilers come unto her, saith the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> A sound of a cry cometh from <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> Because the LORD hath spoiled <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves do roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompences shall surely requite. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose name is the LORD of hosts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of <span class="place">Babylon</span> shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labour in vain, and the folk in the fire, and they shall be weary. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> The word which <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of <span class="person">Judah</span> into <span class="place">Babylon</span> in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> So <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon <span class="place">Babylon</span>, even all these words that are written against <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61</span> And <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> said to Seraiah, When thou comest to <span class="place">Babylon</span>, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62</span> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63</span> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of <span class="place">Euphrates</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64</span> And thou shalt say, Thus shall <span class="place">Babylon</span> sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of <span class="person">Jeremiah</span>.

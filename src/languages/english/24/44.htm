<h3>Chapter 44</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> The word that came to <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> concerning all the Jews which dwell in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, which dwell at <span class="place">Migdol</span>, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and upon all the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span>; and, behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth therein, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Howbeit I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Wherefore my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span> and in the streets of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>; Wherefore commit ye this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of <span class="person">Judah</span>, to leave you none to remain; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> In that ye provoke me unto wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense unto other gods in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, whither ye be gone to dwell, that ye might cut yourselves off, and that ye might be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and in the streets of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> They are not humbled even unto this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And I will take the remnant of <span class="person">Judah</span>, that have set their faces to go into the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even unto the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, as I have punished <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> So that none of the remnant of <span class="person">Judah</span>, which are gone into the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of <span class="person">Judah</span>, to the which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Then all the men which knew that their wives had burned incense unto other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, in Pathros, answered <span class="person">Jeremiah</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> As for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> But we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth, to burn incense unto the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and in the streets of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: for then had we plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink offerings unto her, did we make her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink offerings unto her, without our men? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Then <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> said unto all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people which had given him that answer, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> The incense that ye burned in the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and in the streets of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, ye, and your fathers, your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil is happened unto you, as at this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Moreover <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> said unto all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all <span class="person">Judah</span> that are in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink offerings unto her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all <span class="person">Judah</span> that dwell in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of <span class="person">Judah</span> in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> that are in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Yet a small number that escape the sword shall return out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> into the land of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and all the remnant of <span class="person">Judah</span>, that are gone into the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> to sojourn there, shall know whose words shall stand, mine, or theirs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And this shall be a sign unto you, saith the LORD, that I will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words shall surely stand against you for evil: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give Pharaohhophra king of <span class="place">Egypt</span> into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, his enemy, and that sought his life.

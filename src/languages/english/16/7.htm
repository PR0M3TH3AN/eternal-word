<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the palace, charge over <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up at the first, and found written therein, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of <span class="place">Babylon</span> had carried away, and came again to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> and to <span class="person">Judah</span>, every one unto his city; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah. The number, I say, of the men of the people of <span class="place">Israel</span> was this;

<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> The children of Gazzam, the children of Uzza, the children of Phaseah, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> The children of Besai, the children of Meunim, the children of Nephishesim, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children of Harhur,

<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> The children of <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> The children of Jaala, the children of Darkon, the children of Giddel,

<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> All the Nethinims, and the children of <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s servants, were three hundred ninety and two. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61</span> And these were they which went up also from Telmelah, Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62</span> The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64</span> These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65</span> And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66</span> The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67</span> Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68</span> Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two hundred forty and five: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69</span> Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven hundred and twenty asses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70</span> And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71</span> And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pound of silver. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72</span> And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="73">73</span> So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all <span class="place">Israel</span>, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month came, the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> were in their cities.

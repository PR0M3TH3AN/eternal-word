<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And as <span class="person">Jesus</span> passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this man, or his parents, that he was born blind? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span><span class="word"> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> <span class="word">As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And said unto him, <span class="word">Go, wash in the pool of <span class="place">Siloam</span>,</span> (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Some said, This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> He answered and said, A man that is called <span class="person">Jesus</span> made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, <span class="word">Go to the pool of <span class="place">Siloam</span>, and wash:</span> and I went and washed, and I received sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And it was the sabbath day when <span class="person">Jesus</span> made the clay, and opened his eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him, that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was <span class="person">Christ</span>, he should be put out of the synagogue. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are <span class="person">Moses</span>' disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> We know that God spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>: as for this fellow, we know not from whence he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> The man answered and said unto them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth his will, him he heareth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> If this man were not of God, he could do nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> heard that they had cast him out; and when he had found him, he said unto him, <span class="word">Dost thou believe on the Son of God? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Thou hast both seen him, and it is he that talketh with thee.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And he said, Lord, I believe. And he worshipped him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said, <span class="word">For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">If ye were blind, ye should have no sin: but now ye say, We see; therefore your sin remaineth. </span>

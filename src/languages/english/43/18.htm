<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the which he entered, and his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And <span class="person">Judas</span> also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for <span class="person">Jesus</span> ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> <span class="person">Judas</span> then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns and torches and weapons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore, knowing all things that should come upon him, went forth, and said unto them, <span class="word">Whom seek ye? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> They answered him, <span class="person">Jesus</span> of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>. <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto them, <span class="word">I am he.</span> And <span class="person">Judas</span> also, which betrayed him, stood with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> As soon then as he had said unto them, <span class="word">I am he,</span> they went backward, and fell to the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then asked he them again, <span class="word">Whom seek ye?</span> And they said, <span class="person">Jesus</span> of <span class="place">Nazareth</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye seek me, let these go their way: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, <span class="word">Of them which thou gavest me have I lost none. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Then <span class="person">Simon</span> <span class="person">Peter</span> having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto <span class="person">Peter</span>, <span class="word">Put up thy sword into the sheath: the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and bound him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And led him away to Annas first; for he was father in law to <span class="person">Caiaphas</span>, which was the high priest that same year. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Now <span class="person">Caiaphas</span> was he, which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Simon</span> <span class="person">Peter</span> followed <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and so did another disciple: that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with <span class="person">Jesus</span> into the palace of the high priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> But <span class="person">Peter</span> stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto her that kept the door, and brought in <span class="person">Peter</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then saith the damsel that kept the door unto <span class="person">Peter</span>, Art not thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and <span class="person">Peter</span> stood with them, and warmed himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The high priest then asked <span class="person">Jesus</span> of his disciples, and of his doctrine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered him, <span class="word">I spake openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> <span class="word">Why askest thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have said unto them: behold, they know what I said. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And when he had thus spoken, one of the officers which stood by struck <span class="person">Jesus</span> with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest thou the high priest so? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered him, <span class="word">If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Now Annas had sent him bound unto <span class="person">Caiaphas</span> the high priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And <span class="person">Simon</span> <span class="person">Peter</span> stood and warmed himself. They said therefore unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear <span class="person">Peter</span> cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the garden with him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> <span class="person">Peter</span> then denied again: and immediately the cock crew. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Then led they <span class="person">Jesus</span> from <span class="person">Caiaphas</span> unto the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> then went out unto them, and said, What accusation bring ye against this man? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Then said <span class="person">Pilate</span> unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> That the saying of <span class="person">Jesus</span> might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he should die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Then <span class="person">Pilate</span> entered into the judgment hall again, and called <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered him, <span class="word">Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did others tell it thee of me?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Then cried they all again, saying, Not this man, but <span class="person">Barabbas</span>. Now <span class="person">Barabbas</span> was a robber.

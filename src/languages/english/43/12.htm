<h3>Chapter 12 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then <span class="person">Jesus</span> six days before the passover came to <span class="place">Bethany</span>, where <span class="person">Lazarus</span> was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> There they made him a supper; and <span class="person">Martha</span> served: but <span class="person">Lazarus</span> was one of them that sat at the table with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Then took <span class="person">Mary</span> a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Then saith one of his disciples, <span class="person">Judas</span> Iscariot, <span class="person">Simon</span>'s son, which should betray him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span>, <span class="word">Let her alone: against the day of my burying hath she kept this.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="word">For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not always. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and they came not for <span class="person">Jesus</span>' sake only, but that they might see <span class="person">Lazarus</span> also, whom he had raised from the dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> But the chief priests consulted that they might put <span class="person">Lazarus</span> also to death; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> <span class="place">On</span> the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that <span class="person">Jesus</span> was coming to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of <span class="place">Israel</span> that cometh in the name of the Lord. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span>, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Fear not, daughter of <span class="place">Sion</span>: behold, thy King cometh, sitting on an ass's colt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when <span class="person">Jesus</span> was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> The people therefore that was with him when he called <span class="person">Lazarus</span> out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard that he had done this miracle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to worship at the feast: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> The same came therefore to <span class="person">Philip</span>, which was of <span class="place">Bethsaida</span> of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> <span class="person">Philip</span> cometh and telleth <span class="person">Andrew</span>: and again <span class="person">Andrew</span> and <span class="person">Philip</span> tell <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered them, saying, <span class="word">The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> <span class="word">He that loveth his life shall lose it; and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> <span class="word">If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be: if any man serve me, him will my Father honour. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> <span class="word">Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I unto this hour.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Father, glorify thy name. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> The people therefore, that stood by, and heard it, said that it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered and said, <span class="word">This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> <span class="word">Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span><span class="word"> And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> This he said, signifying what death he should die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> The people answered him, We have heard out of the law that <span class="person">Christ</span> abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, <span class="word">The Son of man must be lifted up?</span> who is this Son of man? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> Then <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">Yet a little while is the light with you. Walk while ye have the light, lest darkness come upon you: for he that walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> <span class="word">While ye have light, believe in the light, that ye may be the children of light. </span>These things spake <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and departed, and did hide himself from them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> But though he had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart; that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> These things said Esaias, when he saw his glory, and spake of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> cried and said, <span class="word">He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span><span class="word"> And he that seeth me seeth him that sent me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> <span class="word">I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> <span class="word">And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> <span class="word">He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> <span class="word">For I have not spoken of myself; but the Father which sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> <span class="word">And I know that his commandment is life everlasting: whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said unto me, so I speak. </span>

<h3>Chapter 5 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and <span class="person">Jesus</span> went up to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Now there is at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, he saith unto him, <span class="word">Wilt thou be made whole?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto him, <span class="word">Rise, take up thy bed, and walk. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee, Take up thy bed, and walk? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for <span class="person">Jesus</span> had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Afterward <span class="person">Jesus</span> findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, <span class="word">Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto thee. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was <span class="person">Jesus</span>, which had made him whole. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And therefore did the Jews persecute <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and sought to slay him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered them, <span class="word">My Father worketh hitherto, and I work.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his Father, making himself equal with God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Then answered <span class="person">Jesus</span> and said unto them, <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also doeth the Son likewise. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> <span class="word">For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these, that ye may marvel. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> <span class="word">For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them; even so the Son quickeneth whom he will. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> <span class="word">For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the Son: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> <span class="word">That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father which hath sent him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death unto life. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> <span class="word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and they that hear shall live. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> <span class="word">For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> <span class="word">And hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> <span class="word">Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> <span class="word">And shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of damnation. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> <span class="word">I can of mine own self do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> <span class="word">If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> <span class="word">There is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> <span class="word">Ye sent unto <span class="person">John</span>, and he bare witness unto the truth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> <span class="word">But I receive not testimony from man: but these things I say, that ye might be saved. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="word">He was a burning and a shining light: and ye were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> <span class="word">But I have greater witness than that of <span class="person">John</span>: for the works which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> <span class="word">And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his shape. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="word">And ye have not his word abiding in you: for whom he hath sent, him ye believe not. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> <span class="word">Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> <span class="word">And ye will not come to me, that ye might have life. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> <span class="word">I receive not honour from men.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> <span class="word">But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> <span class="word">I am come in my Father's name, and ye receive me not: if another shall come in his own name, him ye will receive. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> <span class="word">How can ye believe, which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from God only? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> <span class="word">Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuseth you, even <span class="person">Moses</span>, in whom ye trust. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> <span class="word">For had ye believed <span class="person">Moses</span>, ye would have believed me: for he wrote of me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> <span class="word">But if ye believe not his writings, how shall ye believe my words? </span>

<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> But king <span class="person">Solomon</span> loved many strange women, together with the daughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Zidonians, and Hittites; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Of the nations concerning which the LORD said unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Ye shall not go in to them, neither shall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods: <span class="person">Solomon</span> clave unto these in love. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines: and his wives turned away his heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> For it came to pass, when <span class="person">Solomon</span> was old, that his wives turned away his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, as was the heart of <span class="person">David</span> his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> For <span class="person">Solomon</span> went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fully after the LORD, as did <span class="person">David</span> his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then did <span class="person">Solomon</span> build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of <span class="person">Moab</span>, in the hill that is before <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burnt incense and sacrificed unto their gods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the LORD was angry with <span class="person">Solomon</span>, because his heart was turned from the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, which had appeared unto him twice, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Wherefore the LORD said unto <span class="person">Solomon</span>, Forasmuch as this is done of thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which I have commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, and will give it to thy servant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for <span class="person">David</span> thy father's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give one tribe to thy son for <span class="person">David</span> my servant's sake, and for <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>'s sake which I have chosen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto <span class="person">Solomon</span>, <span class="person">Hadad</span> the Edomite: he was of the king's seed in <span class="person">Edom</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> For it came to pass, when <span class="person">David</span> was in <span class="person">Edom</span>, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in <span class="person">Edom</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> (For six months did Joab remain there with all <span class="place">Israel</span>, until he had cut off every male in <span class="person">Edom</span>:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> That <span class="person">Hadad</span> fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into <span class="place">Egypt</span>; <span class="person">Hadad</span> being yet a little child. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And they arose out of <span class="person">Midian</span>, and came to <span class="place">Paran</span>: and they took men with them out of <span class="place">Paran</span>, and they came to <span class="place">Egypt</span>, unto Pharaoh king of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, and gave him land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Hadad</span> found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh's household among the sons of Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when <span class="person">Hadad</span> heard in <span class="place">Egypt</span> that <span class="person">David</span> slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, <span class="person">Hadad</span> said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And he answered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And he gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when <span class="person">David</span> slew them of Zobah: and they went to <span class="place">Damascus</span>, and dwelt therein, and reigned in <span class="place">Damascus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And he was an adversary to <span class="place">Israel</span> all the days of <span class="person">Solomon</span>, beside the mischief that <span class="person">Hadad</span> did: and he abhorred <span class="place">Israel</span>, and reigned over <span class="place">Syria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda, <span class="person">Solomon</span>'s servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, even he lifted up his hand against the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against the king: <span class="person">Solomon</span> built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city of <span class="person">David</span> his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and <span class="person">Solomon</span> seeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler over all the charge of the house of <span class="person">Joseph</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way; and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone in the field: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him, and rent it in twelve pieces: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he said to Jeroboam, Take thee ten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Behold, I will rend the kingdom out of the hand of <span class="person">Solomon</span>, and will give ten tribes to thee: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> (But he shall have one tribe for my servant <span class="person">David</span>'s sake, and for <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>'s sake, the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mine eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did <span class="person">David</span> his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but I will make him prince all the days of his life for <span class="person">David</span> my servant's sake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will give it unto thee, even ten tribes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And unto his son will I give one tribe, that <span class="person">David</span> my servant may have a light alway before me in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, the city which I have chosen me to put my name there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all that thy soul desireth, and shalt be king over <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I command thee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as <span class="person">David</span> my servant did; that I will be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for <span class="person">David</span>, and will give <span class="place">Israel</span> unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And I will for this afflict the seed of <span class="person">David</span>, but not for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> <span class="person">Solomon</span> sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose, and fled into <span class="place">Egypt</span>, unto Shishak king of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and was in <span class="place">Egypt</span> until the death of <span class="person">Solomon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Solomon</span>, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of <span class="person">Solomon</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And the time that <span class="person">Solomon</span> reigned in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> over all <span class="place">Israel</span> was forty years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of <span class="person">David</span> his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.

<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> made affinity with Pharaoh king of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of <span class="person">David</span>, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> round about. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was no house built unto the name of the LORD, until those days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of <span class="person">David</span> his father: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place: a thousand burnt offerings did <span class="person">Solomon</span> offer upon that altar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> In Gibeon the LORD appeared to <span class="person">Solomon</span> in a dream by night: and God said, Ask what I shall give thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant <span class="person">David</span> my father great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hast kept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son to sit on his throne, as it is this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead of <span class="person">David</span> my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go out or come in. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thy people, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able to judge this thy so great a people? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the speech pleased the LORD, that <span class="person">Solomon</span> had asked this thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, and hast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches for thyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked for thyself understanding to discern judgment; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Behold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, both riches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kings like unto thee all thy days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father <span class="person">David</span> did walk, then I will lengthen thy days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Solomon</span> awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, and stood before him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in one house; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered, that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was no stranger with us in the house, save we two in the house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaid it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, while thine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her dead child in my bosom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, it was dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it was not my son, which I did bear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and the dead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and the living is my son. Thus they spake before the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth, and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is the dead, and my son is the living. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a sword before the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one, and half to the other. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king, for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give her the living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let it be neither mine nor thine, but divide it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, and in no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And all <span class="place">Israel</span> heard of the judgment which the king had judged; and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was in him, to do judgment.

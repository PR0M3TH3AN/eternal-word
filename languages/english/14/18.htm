<h3>Chapter 18 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined affinity with Ahab. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And after certain years he went down to Ahab to <span class="place">Samaria</span>. And Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with him to Ramothgilead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And Ahab king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto Jehoshaphat king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be with thee in the war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Enquire, I pray thee, at the word of the LORD to day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Therefore the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> gathered together of prophets four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD besides, that we might enquire of him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> called for one of his officers, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> and Jehoshaphat king of <span class="person">Judah</span> sat either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of <span class="place">Samaria</span>; and all the prophets prophesied before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron, and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push <span class="place">Syria</span> until they be consumed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him, saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be like one of theirs, and speak thou good. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith, that will I speak. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be delivered into your hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the LORD? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then he said, I did see all <span class="place">Israel</span> scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master; let them return therefore every man to his house in peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven standing on his right hand and on his left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying after this manner, and another saying after that manner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him, and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil against thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from me to speak unto thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Then the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him back to <span class="person">Amon</span> the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until I return in peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> So the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> and Jehoshaphat the king of <span class="person">Judah</span> went up to Ramothgilead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and will go to the battle; but put thou on thy robes. So the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> disguised himself; and they went to the battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Now the king of <span class="place">Syria</span> had commanded the captains of the chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small or great, save only with the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>. Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to depart from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots perceived that it was not the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, they turned back again from pursuing him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> between the joints of the harness: therefore he said to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me out of the host; for I am wounded. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

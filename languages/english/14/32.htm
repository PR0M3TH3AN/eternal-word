<h3>Chapter 32 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib king of <span class="place">Assyria</span> came, and entered into <span class="person">Judah</span>, and encamped against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for himself. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he was purposed to fight against <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and they did help him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the land, saying, Why should the kings of <span class="place">Assyria</span> come, and find much water? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of <span class="person">David</span>, and made darts and shields in abundance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and spake comfortably to them, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>, nor for all the multitude that is with him: for there be more with us than with him: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> After this did Sennacherib king of <span class="place">Assyria</span> send his servants to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and unto all <span class="person">Judah</span> that were at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Thus saith Sennacherib king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>, Whereon do ye trust, that ye abide in the siege in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall deliver us out of the hand of the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his altars, and commanded <span class="person">Judah</span> and <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, saying, Ye shall worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out of mine hand? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall your God deliver you out of mine hand? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and against his servant Hezekiah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, and to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand, so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of mine hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the people of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> that were on the wall, to affright them, and to trouble them; that they might take the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And they spake against the God of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, as against the gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the hands of man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>. So he returned with shame of face to his own land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the sword. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> from the hand of Sennacherib the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>, and from the hand of all other, and guided them on every side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And many brought gifts unto the LORD to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and presents to Hezekiah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>: so that he was magnified in the sight of all nations from thenceforth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was wrath upon him, and upon <span class="person">Judah</span> and <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart, both he and the inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, so that the wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of pleasant jewels; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil; and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of <span class="place">Gihon</span>, and brought it straight down to the west side of the city of <span class="person">David</span>. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of <span class="place">Babylon</span>, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know all that was in his heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span> and <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of <span class="person">David</span>: and all <span class="person">Judah</span> and the inhabitants of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> did him honour at his death. And <span class="person">Manasseh</span> his son reigned in his stead.

<h3>Chapter 9 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now there was a man of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, whose name was Kish, the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he had a son, whose name was <span class="person">Saul</span>, a choice young man, and a goodly: and there was not among the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> a goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the asses of Kish <span class="person">Saul</span>'s father were lost. And Kish said to <span class="person">Saul</span> his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and arise, go seek the asses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And he passed through mount <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and passed through the land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And when they were come to the land of Zuph, <span class="person">Saul</span> said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can shew us our way that we should go. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then said <span class="person">Saul</span> to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels, and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what have we? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the servant answered <span class="person">Saul</span> again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> (Beforetime in <span class="place">Israel</span>, when a man went to enquire of God, thus he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Then said <span class="person">Saul</span> to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So they went unto the city where the man of God was. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the seer here? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And they went up into the city: and when they were come into the city, behold, <span class="person">Samuel</span> came out against them, for to go up to the high place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Now the LORD had told <span class="person">Samuel</span> in his ear a day before <span class="person">Saul</span> came, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the land of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over my people <span class="place">Israel</span>, that he may save my people out of the hand of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because their cry is come unto me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And when <span class="person">Samuel</span> saw <span class="person">Saul</span>, the LORD said unto him, Behold the man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Then <span class="person">Saul</span> drew near to <span class="person">Samuel</span> in the gate, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, where the seer's house is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> answered <span class="person">Saul</span>, and said, I am the seer: go up before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all that is in thine heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the desire of <span class="place">Israel</span>? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's house? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">Saul</span> answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>? and my family the least of all the families of the tribe of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>? wherefore then speakest thou so to me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> took <span class="person">Saul</span> and his servant, and brought them into the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And <span class="person">Samuel</span> said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it, and set it before <span class="person">Saul</span>. And <span class="person">Samuel</span> said, Behold that which is left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So <span class="person">Saul</span> did eat with <span class="person">Samuel</span> that day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And when they were come down from the high place into the city, <span class="person">Samuel</span> communed with <span class="person">Saul</span> upon the top of the house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of the day, that <span class="person">Samuel</span> called <span class="person">Saul</span> to the top of the house, saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And <span class="person">Saul</span> arose, and they went out both of them, he and <span class="person">Samuel</span>, abroad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And as they were going down to the end of the city, <span class="person">Samuel</span> said to <span class="person">Saul</span>, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee the word of God.

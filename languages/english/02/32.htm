<h3>Chapter 32 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And when the people saw that <span class="person">Moses</span> delayed to come down out of the mount, the people gathered themselves together unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, and said unto him, Up, make us gods, which shall go before us; for as for this <span class="person">Moses</span>, the man that brought us up out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, we wot not what is become of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And <span class="person">Aaron</span> said unto them, Break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters, and bring them unto me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And all the people brake off the golden earrings which were in their ears, and brought them unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And he received them at their hand, and fashioned it with a graving tool, after he had made it a molten calf: and they said, These be thy gods, O <span class="place">Israel</span>, which brought thee up out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And when <span class="person">Aaron</span> saw it, he built an altar before it; and <span class="person">Aaron</span> made proclamation, and said, To morrow is a feast to the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Go, get thee down; for thy people, which thou broughtest out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, have corrupted themselves: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them: they have made them a molten calf, and have worshipped it, and have sacrificed thereunto, and said, These be thy gods, O <span class="place">Israel</span>, which have brought thee up out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them: and I will make of thee a great nation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> with great power, and with a mighty hand? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and to consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Remember <span class="person">Abraham</span>, <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and <span class="place">Israel</span>, thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thine own self, and saidst unto them, I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and all this land that I have spoken of will I give unto your seed, and they shall inherit it for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> turned, and went down from the mount, and the two tables of the testimony were in his hand: the tables were written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other were they written. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the tables were the work of God, and the writing was the writing of God, graven upon the tables. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And when <span class="person">Joshua</span> heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, There is a noise of war in the camp. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he said, It is not the voice of them that shout for mastery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being overcome: but the noise of them that sing do I hear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And it came to pass, as soon as he came nigh unto the camp, that he saw the calf, and the dancing: and <span class="person">Moses</span>' anger waxed hot, and he cast the tables out of his hands, and brake them beneath the mount. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strawed it upon the water, and made the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> drink of it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, What did this people unto thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Aaron</span> said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people, that they are set on mischief. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> For they said unto me, Make us gods, which shall go before us: for as for this <span class="person">Moses</span>, the man that brought us up out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, we wot not what is become of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And I said unto them, Whosoever hath any gold, let them break it off. So they gave it me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And when <span class="person">Moses</span> saw that the people were naked; (for <span class="person">Aaron</span> had made them naked unto their shame among their enemies:) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Then <span class="person">Moses</span> stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD's side? let him come unto me. And all the sons of <span class="person">Levi</span> gathered themselves together unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the children of <span class="person">Levi</span> did according to the word of <span class="person">Moses</span>: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> For <span class="person">Moses</span> had said, Consecrate yourselves today to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up unto the LORD; peradventure I shall make an atonement for your sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> returned unto the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin--; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And the LORD said unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Therefore now go, lead the people unto the place of which I have spoken unto thee: behold, mine Angel shall go before thee: nevertheless in the day when I visit I will visit their sin upon them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And the LORD plagued the people, because they made the calf, which <span class="person">Aaron</span> made.

<h3>Chapter 27 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, that when <span class="person">Isaac</span> was old, and his eyes were dim, so that he could not see, he called <span class="person">Esau</span> his eldest son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold, here am I. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my death: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me, that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> heard when <span class="person">Isaac</span> spake to <span class="person">Esau</span> his son. And <span class="person">Esau</span> went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> spake unto <span class="person">Jacob</span> her son, saying, Behold, I heard thy father speak unto <span class="person">Esau</span> thy brother, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat, and bless thee before the LORD before my death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I command thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father, such as he loveth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and that he may bless thee before his death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span> said to <span class="person">Rebekah</span> his mother, Behold, <span class="person">Esau</span> my brother is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a blessing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son: only obey my voice, and go fetch me them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> took goodly raiment of her eldest son <span class="person">Esau</span>, which were with her in the house, and put them upon <span class="person">Jacob</span> her younger son: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands, and upon the smooth of his neck: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son <span class="person">Jacob</span>.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said, Here am I; who art thou, my son? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span> said unto his father, I am <span class="person">Esau</span> thy first born; I have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God brought it to me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> said unto <span class="person">Jacob</span>, Come near, I pray thee, that I may feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son <span class="person">Esau</span> or not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Jacob</span> went near unto <span class="person">Isaac</span> his father; and he felt him, and said, The voice is <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s voice, but the hands are the hands of <span class="person">Esau</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his brother <span class="person">Esau</span>'s hands: so he blessed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And he said, Art thou my very son <span class="person">Esau</span>? And he said, I am. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine, and he drank. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And his father <span class="person">Isaac</span> said unto him, Come near now, and kiss me, my son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that blesseth thee.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And it came to pass, as soon as <span class="person">Isaac</span> had made an end of blessing <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and <span class="person">Jacob</span> was yet scarce gone out from the presence of <span class="person">Isaac</span> his father, that <span class="person">Esau</span> his brother came in from his hunting. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said, I am thy son, thy firstborn <span class="person">Esau</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea, and he shall be blessed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And when <span class="person">Esau</span> heard the words of his father, he cried with a great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father, Bless me, even me also, O my father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken away thy blessing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And he said, Is not he rightly named <span class="person">Jacob</span>? for he hath supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright; and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said, Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> answered and said unto <span class="person">Esau</span>, Behold, I have made him thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and what shall I do now unto thee, my son? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And <span class="person">Esau</span> said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And <span class="person">Esau</span> lifted up his voice, and wept. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And <span class="person">Isaac</span> his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And <span class="person">Esau</span> hated <span class="person">Jacob</span> because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him: and <span class="person">Esau</span> said in his heart, The days of mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my brother <span class="person">Jacob</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And these words of <span class="person">Esau</span> her elder son were told to <span class="person">Rebekah</span>: and she sent and called <span class="person">Jacob</span> her younger son, and said unto him, Behold, thy brother <span class="person">Esau</span>, as touching thee, doth comfort himself, purposing to kill thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; and arise, flee thou to <span class="person">Laban</span> my brother to <span class="person">Haran</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn away; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in one day? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And <span class="person">Rebekah</span> said to <span class="person">Isaac</span>, I am weary of my life because of the daughters of <span class="person">Heth</span>: if <span class="person">Jacob</span> take a wife of the daughters of <span class="person">Heth</span>, such as these which are of the daughters of the land, what good shall my life do me?

<h3>Chapter 41</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other kine upon the brink of the river. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then Pharaoh sent and called <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> for badness: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the east wind, sprung up after them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare it to me.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with the east wind shall be seven years of famine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; and the famine shall consume the land; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> in the seven plenteous years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven years of famine, which shall be in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; that the land perish not through the famine.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of all his servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater than thou. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, See, I have set thee over all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had; and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler over all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And Pharaoh said unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>, I am Pharaoh, and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And Pharaoh called <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s name <span class="person">Zaphnathpaaneah</span>; and he gave him to wife <span class="person">Asenath</span> the daughter of <span class="person">Potipherah</span> priest of <span class="place">On</span>. And <span class="person">Joseph</span> went out over all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. And <span class="person">Joseph</span> went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by handfuls. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and laid up the food in the cities: the food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he up in the same. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much, until he left numbering; for it was without number.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And unto <span class="person">Joseph</span> were born two sons before the years of famine came, which <span class="person">Asenath</span> the daughter of <span class="person">Potipherah</span> priest of <span class="place">On</span> bare unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And <span class="person">Joseph</span> called the name of the firstborn <span class="person">Manasseh</span>: For God, said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> And the name of the second called he <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: For God hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, were ended. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as <span class="person">Joseph</span> had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> there was bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> And when all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians, Go unto <span class="person">Joseph</span>; what he saith to you, do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: And <span class="person">Joseph</span> opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and the famine waxed sore in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> And all countries came into <span class="place">Egypt</span> to <span class="person">Joseph</span> for to buy corn; because that the famine was so sore in all lands.

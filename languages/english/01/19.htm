<h3>Chapter 19 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And there came two angels to <span class="place">Sodom</span> at even; and <span class="person">Lot</span> sat in the gate of <span class="place">Sodom</span>: and <span class="person">Lot</span> seeing them rose up to meet them; and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet, and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him, and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did bake unleavened bread, and they did eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of <span class="place">Sodom</span>, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people from every quarter: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they called unto <span class="person">Lot</span>, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that we may know them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And <span class="person">Lot</span> went out at the door unto them, and shut the door after him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for therefore came they under the shadow of my roof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed sore upon the man, even <span class="person">Lot</span>, and came near to break the door. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled <span class="person">Lot</span> into the house to them, and shut to the door. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied themselves to find the door.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the men said unto <span class="person">Lot</span>, Hast thou here any besides? son in law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast in the city, bring them out of this place: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath sent us to destroy it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And <span class="person">Lot</span> went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as one that mocked unto his sons in law.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened <span class="person">Lot</span>, saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought him forth, and set him without the city. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And <span class="person">Lot</span> said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest some evil take me, and I die: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and my soul shall live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the which thou hast spoken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called <span class="place">Zoar</span>.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> The sun was risen upon the earth when <span class="person">Lot</span> entered into <span class="place">Zoar</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Then the LORD rained upon <span class="place">Sodom</span> and upon <span class="place">Gomorrah</span> brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a pillar of salt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And <span class="person">Abraham</span> gat up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the LORD: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And he looked toward <span class="place">Sodom</span> and <span class="place">Gomorrah</span>, and toward all the land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a furnace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, that God remembered <span class="person">Abraham</span>, and sent <span class="person">Lot</span> out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the which <span class="person">Lot</span> dwelt.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And <span class="person">Lot</span> went up out of <span class="place">Zoar</span>, and dwelt in the mountain, and his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in <span class="place">Zoar</span>: and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old, and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after the manner of all the earth: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose.  
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father: let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in, and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she lay down, nor when she arose. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Thus were both the daughters of <span class="person">Lot</span> with child by their father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And the first born bare a son, and called his name <span class="person">Moab</span>: the same is the father of the Moabites unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day.

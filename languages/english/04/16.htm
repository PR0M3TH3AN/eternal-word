<h3>Chapter 16 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now <span class="person">Korah</span>, the son of <span class="person">Izhar</span>, the son of <span class="person">Kohath</span>, the son of <span class="person">Levi</span>, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and <span class="place">On</span>, the son of Peleth, sons of <span class="person">Reuben</span>, took men: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And they rose up before <span class="person">Moses</span>, with certain of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And they gathered themselves together against <span class="person">Moses</span> and against <span class="person">Aaron</span>, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And when <span class="person">Moses</span> heard it, he fell upon his face: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he spake unto <span class="person">Korah</span> and unto all his company, saying, Even to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> This do; Take you censers, <span class="person">Korah</span>, and all his company; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of <span class="person">Levi</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto <span class="person">Korah</span>, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of <span class="person">Levi</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of <span class="place">Israel</span> hath separated you from the congregation of <span class="place">Israel</span>, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto them? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of <span class="person">Levi</span> with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered together against the LORD: and what is <span class="person">Aaron</span>, that ye murmur against him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: which said, We will not come up: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto <span class="person">Korah</span>, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and <span class="person">Aaron</span>, to morrow: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also, and <span class="person">Aaron</span>, each of you his censer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Korah</span> gathered all the congregation against them unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> and unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the tabernacle of <span class="person">Korah</span>, Dathan, and Abiram. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of <span class="place">Israel</span> followed him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> So they gat up from the tabernacle of <span class="person">Korah</span>, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own mind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained unto <span class="person">Korah</span>, and all their goods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And all <span class="place">Israel</span> that were round about them fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> Speak unto <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> To be a memorial unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that no stranger, which is not of the seed of <span class="person">Aaron</span>, come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as <span class="person">Korah</span>, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> murmured against <span class="person">Moses</span> and against <span class="person">Aaron</span>, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against <span class="person">Moses</span> and against <span class="person">Aaron</span>, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> came before the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> said unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Take a censer, and put fire therein from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And <span class="person">Aaron</span> took as <span class="person">Moses</span> commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of <span class="person">Korah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> And <span class="person">Aaron</span> returned unto <span class="person">Moses</span> unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

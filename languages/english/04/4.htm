<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> and unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Take the sum of the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> from among the sons of <span class="person">Levi</span>, after their families, by the house of their fathers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old, all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> This shall be the service of the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And when the camp setteth forward, <span class="person">Aaron</span> shall come, and his sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover the ark of testimony with it: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in the staves thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread shall be thereon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in the staves thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they minister unto it: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue, and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put to the staves thereof: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put them on a bar: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread a purple cloth thereon: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and put to the staves of it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And when <span class="person">Aaron</span> and his sons have made an end of covering the sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp is to set forward; after that, the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> shall come to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they die. These things are the burden of the sons of <span class="person">Kohath</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And to the office of <span class="person">Eleazar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is, in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span> and unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from among the Levites: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when they approach unto the most holy things: <span class="person">Aaron</span> and his sons shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to his burden: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are covered, lest they die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the LORD spake unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, saying, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Take also the sum of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span>, throughout the houses of their fathers, by their families; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to serve, and for burdens: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they serve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> At the appointment of <span class="person">Aaron</span> and his sons shall be all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens, and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in charge all their burdens. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> This is the service of the families of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span> in the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be under the hand of <span class="person">Ithamar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> As for the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span>, thou shalt number them after their families, by the house of their fathers; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and sockets thereof, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets, and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments, and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the instruments of the charge of their burden. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> This is the service of the families of the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span>, according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the congregation, under the hand of <span class="person">Ithamar</span> the son of <span class="person">Aaron</span> the priest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> and the chief of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And those that were numbered of them by their families were two thousand seven hundred and fifty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> These were they that were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, which <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> did number according to the commandment of the LORD by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And those that were numbered of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span>, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the tabernacle of the congregation, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and six hundred and thirty. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons of <span class="person">Gershon</span>, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of the congregation, whom <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> did number according to the commandment of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span>, throughout their families, by the house of their fathers,

<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons of <span class="person">Merari</span>, whom <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> numbered according to the word of the LORD by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom <span class="person">Moses</span> and <span class="person">Aaron</span> and the chief of <span class="place">Israel</span> numbered, after their families, and after the house of their fathers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old, every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation,

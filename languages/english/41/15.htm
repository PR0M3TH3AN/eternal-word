<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And straightway in the morning the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council, and bound <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and carried him away, and delivered him to <span class="person">Pilate</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> asked him, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answering said unto him, <span class="word">Thou sayest it.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the chief priests accused him of many things: but he answered nothing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> asked him again, saying, Answerest thou nothing? behold how many things they witness against thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But <span class="person">Jesus</span> yet answered nothing; so that <span class="person">Pilate</span> marvelled. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Now at that feast he released unto them one prisoner, whomsoever they desired. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And there was one named <span class="person">Barabbas</span>, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the multitude crying aloud began to desire him to do as he had ever done unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> But <span class="person">Pilate</span> answered them, saying, Will ye that I release unto you the King of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> For he knew that the chief priests had delivered him for envy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> But the chief priests moved the people, that he should rather release <span class="person">Barabbas</span> unto them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> answered and said again unto them, What will ye then that I shall do unto him whom ye call the King of the Jews? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And they cried out again, Crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then <span class="person">Pilate</span> said unto them, Why, what evil hath he done? And they cried out the more exceedingly, Crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And so <span class="person">Pilate</span>, willing to content the people, released <span class="person">Barabbas</span> unto them, and delivered <span class="person">Jesus</span>, when he had scourged him, to be crucified. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And the soldiers led him away into the hall, called Praetorium; and they call together the whole band. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And they smote him on the head with a reed, and did spit upon him, and bowing their knees worshipped him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And they compel one <span class="person">Simon</span> a Cyrenian, who passed by, coming out of the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to bear his cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And they bring him unto the place <span class="place">Golgotha</span>, which is, being interpreted, The place of a skull. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh: but he received it not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the superscription of his accusation was written over, THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And with him they crucify two thieves; the one on his right hand, and the other on his left. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And the scripture was fulfilled, which saith, And he was numbered with the transgressors. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And they that passed by railed on him, wagging their heads, and saying, Ah, thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest it in three days, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Save thyself, and come down from the cross. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Likewise also the chief priests mocking said among themselves with the scribes, He saved others; himself he cannot save. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Let <span class="person">Christ</span> the King of <span class="place">Israel</span> descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him reviled him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And when the sixth hour was come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And at the ninth hour <span class="person">Jesus</span> cried with a loud voice, saying, <span class="word">Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span> which is, being interpreted, <span class="word">My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And some of them that stood by, when they heard it, said, Behold, he calleth Elias. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And one ran and filled a spunge full of vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him to drink, saying, Let alone; let us see whether Elias will come to take him down. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> cried with a loud voice, and gave up the ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And when the centurion, which stood over against him, saw that he so cried out, and gave up the ghost, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was <span class="person">Mary</span> <span class="person">Magdalene</span>, and <span class="person">Mary</span> the mother of <span class="person">James</span> the less and of <span class="person">Joses</span>, and Salome; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> (Who also, when he was in <span class="place">Galilee</span>, followed him, and ministered unto him;) and many other women which came up with him unto <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And now when the even was come, because it was the preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> <span class="person">Joseph</span> of <span class="place">Arimathaea</span>, an honourable counsellor, which also waited for the kingdom of God, came, and went in boldly unto <span class="person">Pilate</span>, and craved the body of <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> marvelled if he were already dead: and calling unto him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been any while dead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> And when he knew it of the centurion, he gave the body to <span class="person">Joseph</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> And he bought fine linen, and took him down, and wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn out of a rock, and rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre. 
<br />
<span class="verse" id="47">47</span> And <span class="person">Mary</span> <span class="person">Magdalene</span> and <span class="person">Mary</span> the mother of <span class="person">Joses</span> beheld where he was laid.

<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> In those days the multitude being very great, and having nothing to eat, <span class="person">Jesus</span> called his disciples unto him, and saith unto them, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> <span class="word">I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now been with me three days, and have nothing to eat:</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> <span class="word">And if I send them away fasting to their own houses, they will faint by the way: for divers of them came from far.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And his disciples answered him, From whence can a man satisfy these men with bread here in the wilderness? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he asked them, <span class="word">How many loaves have ye?</span> And they said, Seven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And he commanded the people to sit down on the ground: and he took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake, and gave to his disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And they had a few small fishes: and he blessed, and commanded to set them also before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> So they did eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And they that had eaten were about four thousand: and he sent them away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And straightway he entered into a ship with his disciples, and came into the parts of Dalmanutha. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with him, seeking of him a sign from heaven, tempting him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and saith, <span class="word">Why doth this generation seek after a sign? verily I say unto you, There shall no sign be given unto this generation.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And he charged them, saying, <span class="word">Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of <span class="person">Herod</span>.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we have no bread. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And when <span class="person">Jesus</span> knew it, he saith unto them, <span class="word">Why reason ye, because ye have no bread? perceive ye not yet, neither understand? have ye your heart yet hardened?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> <span class="word">Having eyes, see ye not? and having ears, hear ye not? and do ye not remember? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> <span class="word">When I brake the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> They say unto him, Twelve. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> <span class="word">And when the seven among four thousand, how many baskets full of fragments took ye up?</span> And they said, Seven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">How is it that ye do not understand? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And he cometh to <span class="place">Bethsaida</span>; and they bring a blind man unto him, and besought him to touch him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And he took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town; and when he had spit on his eyes, and put his hands upon him, he asked him if he saw ought. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> After that he put his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up: and he was restored, and saw every man clearly. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And he sent him away to his house, saying, <span class="word">Neither go into the town, nor tell it to any in the town.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> went out, and his disciples, into the towns of <span class="place">Caesarea</span> <span class="place">Philippi</span>: and by the way he asked his disciples, saying unto them, <span class="word">Whom do men say that I am? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And they answered, <span class="person">John</span> the Baptist: but some say, Elias; and others, One of the prophets. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And he saith unto them, <span class="word">But whom say ye that I am?</span> And <span class="person">Peter</span> answereth and saith unto him, Thou art the <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And he charged them that they should tell no man of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And he began to teach them, that the Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders, and of the chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and after three days rise again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And he spake that saying openly. And <span class="person">Peter</span> took him, and began to rebuke him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> But when he had turned about and looked on his disciples, he rebuked <span class="person">Peter</span>, saying, <span class="word">Get thee behind me, <span class="person">Satan</span>: for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but the things that be of men.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also, he said unto them, <span class="word">Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="word">For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospel's, the same shall save it. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> <span class="word">For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> <span class="word">Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="word">Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him also shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. </span>

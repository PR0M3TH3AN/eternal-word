<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove <span class="place">Israel</span> by them, even as many of <span class="place">Israel</span> as had not known all the wars of <span class="place">Canaan</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Only that the generations of the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> might know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing thereof; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And they were to prove <span class="place">Israel</span> by them, to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> dwelt among the Canaanites, Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and Jebusites: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against <span class="place">Israel</span>, and he sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of <span class="place">Mesopotamia</span>: and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> served Chushanrishathaim eight years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And when the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of <span class="person">Kenaz</span>, Caleb's younger brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged <span class="place">Israel</span>, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered Chushanrishathaim king of <span class="place">Mesopotamia</span> into his hand; and his hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of <span class="person">Kenaz</span> died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> did evil again in the sight of the LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of <span class="person">Moab</span> against <span class="place">Israel</span>, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and <span class="person">Amalek</span>, and went and smote <span class="place">Israel</span>, and possessed the city of palm trees. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> So the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> served Eglon the king of <span class="person">Moab</span> eighteen years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> But when the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> cried unto the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of <span class="person">Gera</span>, a Benjamite, a man lefthanded: and by him the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> sent a present unto Eglon the king of <span class="person">Moab</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right thigh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he brought the present unto Eglon king of <span class="person">Moab</span>: and Eglon was a very fat man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away the people that bare the present. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king: who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of his belly; and the dirt came out. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of the parlour upon him, and locked them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said, Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped unto Seirath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet in the mountain of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and the children of <span class="place">Israel</span> went down with him from the mount, and he before them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of <span class="place">Jordan</span> toward <span class="person">Moab</span>, and suffered not a man to pass over. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And they slew of <span class="person">Moab</span> at that time about ten thousand men, all lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> So <span class="person">Moab</span> was subdued that day under the hand of <span class="place">Israel</span>. And the land had rest fourscore years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also delivered <span class="place">Israel</span>.

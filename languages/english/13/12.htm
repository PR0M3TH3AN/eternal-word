<h3>Chapter 12 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now these are they that came to <span class="person">David</span> to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of <span class="person">Saul</span> the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a bow, even of <span class="person">Saul</span>'s brethren of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and over the thirty; and <span class="person">Jeremiah</span>, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and Josabad the Gederathite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and Shephatiah the Haruphite, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> <span class="person">Elkanah</span>, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto <span class="person">David</span> into the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the roes upon the mountains; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> <span class="person">Ezer</span> the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Mishmannah the fourth, <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> the fifth, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> <span class="person">Jeremiah</span> the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> These were of the sons of <span class="person">Gad</span>, captains of the host: one of the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> These are they that went over <span class="place">Jordan</span> in the first month, when it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the west. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And there came of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> and <span class="person">Judah</span> to the hold unto <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And <span class="person">David</span> went out to meet them, and answered and said unto them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the captains, and he said, Thine are we, <span class="person">David</span>, and on thy side, thou son of <span class="person">Jesse</span>: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then <span class="person">David</span> received them, and made them captains of the band. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And there fell some of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> to <span class="person">David</span>, when he came with the Philistines against <span class="person">Saul</span> to battle: but they helped them not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him away, saying, He will fall to his master <span class="person">Saul</span> to the jeopardy of our heads. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, Adnah, and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu, and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And they helped <span class="person">David</span> against the band of the rovers: for they were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> For at that time day by day there came to <span class="person">David</span> to help him, until it was a great host, like the host of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed to the war, and came to <span class="person">David</span> to <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>, to turn the kingdom of <span class="person">Saul</span> to him, according to the word of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> The children of <span class="person">Judah</span> that bare shield and spear were six thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Of the children of <span class="person">Simeon</span>, mighty men of valour for the war, seven thousand and one hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Of the children of <span class="person">Levi</span> four thousand and six hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's house twenty and two captains. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And of the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, the kindred of <span class="person">Saul</span>, three thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the ward of the house of <span class="person">Saul</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And of the children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span> twenty thousand and eight hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of their fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And of the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span> eighteen thousand, which were expressed by name, to come and make <span class="person">David</span> king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And of the children of <span class="person">Issachar</span>, which were men that had understanding of the times, to know what <span class="place">Israel</span> ought to do; the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren were at their commandment. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Of <span class="person">Zebulun</span>, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank: they were not of double heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And of <span class="person">Naphtali</span> a thousand captains, and with them with shield and spear thirty and seven thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and six hundred. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And of <span class="person">Asher</span>, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, forty thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And on the other side of <span class="place">Jordan</span>, of the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and of the half tribe of <span class="person">Manasseh</span>, with all manner of instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty thousand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a perfect heart to <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>, to make <span class="person">David</span> king over all <span class="place">Israel</span>: and all the rest also of <span class="place">Israel</span> were of one heart to make <span class="person">David</span> king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And there they were with <span class="person">David</span> three days, eating and drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto <span class="person">Issachar</span> and <span class="person">Zebulun</span> and <span class="person">Naphtali</span>, brought bread on asses, and on camels, and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep abundantly: for there was joy in <span class="place">Israel</span>.

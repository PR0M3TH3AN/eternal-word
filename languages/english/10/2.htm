<h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass after this, that <span class="person">David</span> enquired of the LORD, saying, Shall I go up into any of the cities of <span class="person">Judah</span>? And the LORD said unto him, Go up. And <span class="person">David</span> said, Whither shall I go up? And he said, Unto <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> So <span class="person">David</span> went up thither, and his two wives also, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail Nabal's wife the Carmelite. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And his men that were with him did <span class="person">David</span> bring up, every man with his household: and they dwelt in the cities of <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> came, and there they anointed <span class="person">David</span> king over the house of <span class="person">Judah</span>. And they told <span class="person">David</span>, saying, That the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried <span class="person">Saul</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And <span class="person">David</span> sent messengers unto the men of Jabeshgilead, and said unto them, Blessed be ye of the LORD, that ye have shewed this kindness unto your lord, even unto <span class="person">Saul</span>, and have buried him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And now the LORD shew kindness and truth unto you: and I also will requite you this kindness, because ye have done this thing. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Therefore now let your hands be strengthened, and be ye valiant: for your master <span class="person">Saul</span> is dead, and also the house of <span class="person">Judah</span> have anointed me king over them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> But Abner the son of Ner, captain of <span class="person">Saul</span>'s host, took Ishbosheth the son of <span class="person">Saul</span>, and brought him over to <span class="place">Mahanaim</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And made him king over <span class="place">Gilead</span>, and over the Ashurites, and over Jezreel, and over <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and over <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, and over all <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Ishbosheth <span class="person">Saul</span>'s son was forty years old when he began to reign over <span class="place">Israel</span>, and reigned two years. But the house of <span class="person">Judah</span> followed <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the time that <span class="person">David</span> was king in <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span> over the house of <span class="person">Judah</span> was seven years and six months. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth the son of <span class="person">Saul</span>, went out from <span class="place">Mahanaim</span> to Gibeon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Joab the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of <span class="person">David</span>, went out, and met together by the pool of Gibeon: and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And Abner said to Joab, Let the young men now arise, and play before us. And Joab said, Let them arise. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Then there arose and went over by number twelve of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, which pertained to Ishbosheth the son of <span class="person">Saul</span>, and twelve of the servants of <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And they caught every one his fellow by the head, and thrust his sword in his fellow's side; so they fell down together: wherefore that place was called Helkathhazzurim, which is in Gibeon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And there was a very sore battle that day; and Abner was beaten, and the men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, before the servants of <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And there were three sons of Zeruiah there, Joab, and Abishai, and Asahel: and Asahel was as light of foot as a wild roe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Then Abner looked behind him, and said, Art thou Asahel? And he answered, I am. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And Abner said to him, Turn thee aside to thy right hand or to thy left, and lay thee hold on one of the young men, and take thee his armour. But Asahel would not turn aside from following of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Howbeit he refused to turn aside: wherefore Abner with the hinder end of the spear smote him under the fifth rib, that the spear came out behind him; and he fell down there, and died in the same place: and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Joab also and Abishai pursued after Abner: and the sun went down when they were come to the hill of Ammah, that lieth before Giah by the way of the wilderness of Gibeon. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And the children of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> gathered themselves together after Abner, and became one troop, and stood on the top of an hill. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Then Abner called to Joab, and said, Shall the sword devour for ever? knowest thou not that it will be bitterness in the latter end? how long shall it be then, ere thou bid the people return from following their brethren? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And Joab said, As God liveth, unless thou hadst spoken, surely then in the morning the people had gone up every one from following his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> So Joab blew a trumpet, and all the people stood still, and pursued after <span class="place">Israel</span> no more, neither fought they any more. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And Abner and his men walked all that night through the plain, and passed over <span class="place">Jordan</span>, and went through all Bithron, and they came to <span class="place">Mahanaim</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And Joab returned from following Abner: and when he had gathered all the people together, there lacked of <span class="person">David</span>'s servants nineteen men and Asahel. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> But the servants of <span class="person">David</span> had smitten of <span class="person">Benjamin</span>, and of Abner's men, so that three hundred and threescore men died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And they took up Asahel, and buried him in the sepulchre of his father, which was in <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>. And Joab and his men went all night, and they came to <span class="person"><span class="place">Hebron</span></span> at break of day.

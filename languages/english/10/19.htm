<h3>Chapter 19 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it was told Joab, Behold, the king weepeth and mourneth for Absalom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> But the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And Joab came into the house to the king, and said, Thou hast shamed this day the faces of all thy servants, which this day have saved thy life, and the lives of thy sons and of thy daughters, and the lives of thy wives, and the lives of thy concubines; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> In that thou lovest thine enemies, and hatest thy friends. For thou hast declared this day, that thou regardest neither princes nor servants: for this day I perceive, that if Absalom had lived, and all we had died this day, then it had pleased thee well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Now therefore arise, go forth, and speak comfortably unto thy servants: for I swear by the LORD, if thou go not forth, there will not tarry one with thee this night: and that will be worse unto thee than all the evil that befell thee from thy youth until now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Then the king arose, and sat in the gate. And they told unto all the people, saying, Behold, the king doth sit in the gate. And all the people came before the king: for <span class="place">Israel</span> had fled every man to his tent. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying, The king saved us out of the hand of our enemies, and he delivered us out of the hand of the Philistines; and now he is fled out of the land for Absalom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle. Now therefore why speak ye not a word of bringing the king back? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And king <span class="person">David</span> sent to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, Speak unto the elders of <span class="person">Judah</span>, saying, Why are ye the last to bring the king back to his house? seeing the speech of all <span class="place">Israel</span> is come to the king, even to his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh: wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And say ye to Amasa, Art thou not of my bone, and of my flesh? God do so to me, and more also, if thou be not captain of the host before me continually in the room of Joab. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he bowed the heart of all the men of <span class="person">Judah</span>, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word unto the king, Return thou, and all thy servants. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> So the king returned, and came to <span class="place">Jordan</span>. And <span class="person">Judah</span> came to Gilgal, to go to meet the king, to conduct the king over <span class="place">Jordan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And Shimei the son of <span class="person">Gera</span>, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hasted and came down with the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> to meet king <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And there were a thousand men of <span class="person">Benjamin</span> with him, and Ziba the servant of the house of <span class="person">Saul</span>, and his fifteen sons and his twenty servants with him; and they went over <span class="place">Jordan</span> before the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And there went over a ferry boat to carry over the king's household, and to do what he thought good. And Shimei the son of <span class="person">Gera</span> fell down before the king, as he was come over <span class="place">Jordan</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And said unto the king, Let not my lord impute iniquity unto me, neither do thou remember that which thy servant did perversely the day that my lord the king went out of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, that the king should take it to his heart. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> For thy servant doth know that I have sinned: therefore, behold, I am come the first this day of all the house of <span class="person">Joseph</span> to go down to meet my lord the king. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> But Abishai the son of Zeruiah answered and said, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD's anointed? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">David</span> said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye should this day be adversaries unto me? shall there any man be put to death this day in <span class="place">Israel</span>? for do not I know that I am this day king over <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Therefore the king said unto Shimei, Thou shalt not die. And the king sware unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And Mephibosheth the son of <span class="person">Saul</span> came down to meet the king, and had neither dressed his feet, nor trimmed his beard, nor washed his clothes, from the day the king departed until the day he came again in peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And it came to pass, when he was come to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> to meet the king, that the king said unto him, Wherefore wentest not thou with me, Mephibosheth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And he answered, My lord, O king, my servant deceived me: for thy servant said, I will saddle me an ass, that I may ride thereon, and go to the king; because thy servant is lame. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he hath slandered thy servant unto my lord the king; but my lord the king is as an angel of God: do therefore what is good in thine eyes. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> For all of my father's house were but dead men before my lord the king: yet didst thou set thy servant among them that did eat at thine own table. What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And the king said unto him, Why speakest thou any more of thy matters? I have said, Thou and Ziba divide the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And Mephibosheth said unto the king, Yea, let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim, and went over <span class="place">Jordan</span> with the king, to conduct him over <span class="place">Jordan</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old: and he had provided the king of sustenance while he lay at <span class="place">Mahanaim</span>; for he was a very great man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And the king said unto Barzillai, Come thou over with me, and I will feed thee with me in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And Barzillai said unto the king, How long have I to live, that I should go up with the king unto <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> I am this day fourscore years old: and can I discern between good and evil? can thy servant taste what I eat or what I drink? can I hear any more the voice of singing men and singing women? wherefore then should thy servant be yet a burden unto my lord the king? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Thy servant will go a little way over <span class="place">Jordan</span> with the king: and why should the king recompense it me with such a reward? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> Let thy servant, I pray thee, turn back again, that I may die in mine own city, and be buried by the grave of my father and of my mother. But behold thy servant Chimham; let him go over with my lord the king; and do to him what shall seem good unto thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And the king answered, Chimham shall go over with me, and I will do to him that which shall seem good unto thee: and whatsoever thou shalt require of me, that will I do for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And all the people went over <span class="place">Jordan</span>. And when the king was come over, the king kissed Barzillai, and blessed him; and he returned unto his own place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him: and all the people of <span class="person">Judah</span> conducted the king, and also half the people of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And, behold, all the men of <span class="place">Israel</span> came to the king, and said unto the king, Why have our brethren the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> stolen thee away, and have brought the king, and his household, and all <span class="person">David</span>'s men with him, over <span class="place">Jordan</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And all the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> answered the men of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Because the king is near of kin to us: wherefore then be ye angry for this matter? have we eaten at all of the king's cost? or hath he given us any gift? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And the men of <span class="place">Israel</span> answered the men of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and said, We have ten parts in the king, and we have also more right in <span class="person">David</span> than ye: why then did ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our king? And the words of the men of <span class="person">Judah</span> were fiercer than the words of the men of <span class="place">Israel</span>.

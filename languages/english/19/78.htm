<h3>Psalm 78</h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> For he established a testimony in <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and appointed a law in <span class="place">Israel</span>, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> That the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> The children of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, being armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his law; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, in the field of Zoan. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh for his people? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against <span class="person">Jacob</span>, and anger also came up against <span class="place">Israel</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and enquired early after God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> How he had wrought his signs in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and his wonders in the field of Zoan: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their labour unto the locust. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees with frost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And smote all the firstborn in <span class="place">Egypt</span>; the chief of their strength in the tabernacles of <span class="person"><span class="place">Ham</span></span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of <span class="place">Israel</span> to dwell in their tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred <span class="place">Israel</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="61">61</span> And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy's hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="62">62</span> He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="63">63</span> The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="64">64</span> Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="65">65</span> Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="66">66</span> And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="67">67</span> Moreover he refused the tabernacle of <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and chose not the tribe of <span class="person">Ephraim</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="68">68</span> But chose the tribe of <span class="person">Judah</span>, the mount Zion which he loved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="69">69</span> And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="70">70</span> He chose <span class="person">David</span> also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="71">71</span> From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed <span class="person">Jacob</span> his people, and <span class="place">Israel</span> his inheritance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="72">72</span> So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

<h3>Chapter 20 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And spake unto him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he answered and said unto them, <span class="word">I will also ask you one thing; and answer me: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> <span class="word">The baptism of <span class="person">John</span>, was it from heaven, or of men? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> But and if we say, Of men; all the people will stone us: for they be persuaded that <span class="person">John</span> was a prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And they answered, that they could not tell whence it was. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">Neither tell I you by what authority I do these things. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then began he to speak to the people this parable; <span class="word">A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it forth to husbandmen, and went into a far country for a long time. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span><span class="word"> And at the season he sent a servant to the husbandmen, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> <span class="word">And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and entreated him shamefully, and sent him away empty. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span><span class="word"> And again he sent a third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> <span class="word">Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be they will reverence him when they see him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> <span class="word">But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> <span class="word">So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do unto them? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> <span class="word">He shall come and destroy these husbandmen, and shall give the vineyard to others.</span> And when they heard it, they said, God forbid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he beheld them, and said, <span class="word">What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span><span class="word"> Whosoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And they watched him, and sent forth spies, which should feign themselves just men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him unto the power and authority of the governor. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Is it lawful for us to give tribute unto <span class="person">Caesar</span>, or no? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> But he perceived their craftiness, and said unto them, <span class="word">Why tempt ye me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="word">Shew me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it?</span> They answered and said, <span class="person">Caesar</span>'s. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">Render therefore unto <span class="person">Caesar</span> the things which be <span class="person">Caesar</span>'s, and unto God the things which be God's. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Then came to him certain of the Sadducees , which deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Saying, Master, <span class="person">Moses</span> wrote unto us, If any man's brother die, having a wife, and he die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> There were therefore seven brethren: and the first took a wife, and died without children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And the second took her to wife, and he died childless. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Last of all the woman died also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her to wife. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And <span class="person">Jesus</span> answering said unto them, <span class="word">The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="word">But they which shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span><span class="word"> Neither can they die any more: for they are equal unto the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span><span class="word"> Now that the dead are raised, even <span class="person">Moses</span> shewed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of <span class="person">Abraham</span>, and the God of <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and the God of <span class="person">Jacob</span>. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="word">For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live unto him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And after that they durst not ask him any question at all. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And he said unto them, <span class="word">How say they that <span class="person">Christ</span> is <span class="person">David</span>'s son? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span><span class="word"> And <span class="person">David</span> himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> <span class="word">Till I make thine enemies thy footstool. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span><span class="word"> <span class="person">David</span> therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Then in the audience of all the people he said unto his disciples, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> <span class="word">Beware of the scribes, which desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the chief rooms at feasts; </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> <span class="word">Which devour widows' houses, and for a shew make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation. </span>

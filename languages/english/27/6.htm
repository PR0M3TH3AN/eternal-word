<h3>Chapter 6 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> It pleased <span class="person">Darius</span> to set over the kingdom an hundred and twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And over these three presidents; of whom <span class="person">Daniel</span> was first: that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king should have no damage. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Then this <span class="person">Daniel</span> was preferred above the presidents and princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king thought to set him over the whole realm. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion against <span class="person">Daniel</span> concerning the kingdom; but they could find none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither was there any error or fault found in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against this <span class="person">Daniel</span>, except we find it against him concerning the law of his God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the king, and said thus unto him, King <span class="person">Darius</span>, live for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into the den of lions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Wherefore king <span class="person">Darius</span> signed the writing and the decree. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Now when <span class="person">Daniel</span> knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Then these men assembled, and found <span class="person">Daniel</span> praying and making supplication before his God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Then answered they and said before the king, That <span class="person">Daniel</span>, which is of the children of the captivity of <span class="person">Judah</span>, regardeth not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but maketh his petition three times a day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased with himself, and set his heart on <span class="person">Daniel</span> to deliver him: and he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is, That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be changed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then the king commanded, and they brought <span class="person">Daniel</span>, and cast him into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto <span class="person">Daniel</span>, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den; and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed concerning <span class="person">Daniel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before him: and his sleep went from him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in haste unto the den of lions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice unto <span class="person">Daniel</span>: and the king spake and said to <span class="person">Daniel</span>, O <span class="person">Daniel</span>, servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest continually, able to deliver thee from the lions? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Then said <span class="person">Daniel</span> unto the king, O king, live for ever. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths, that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no hurt. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Then was the king exceeding glad for him, and commanded that they should take <span class="person">Daniel</span> up out of the den. So <span class="person">Daniel</span> was taken up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him, because he believed in his God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused <span class="person">Daniel</span>, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Then king <span class="person">Darius</span> wrote unto all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied unto you. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the God of <span class="person">Daniel</span>: for he is the living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto the end. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered <span class="person">Daniel</span> from the power of the lions. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> So this <span class="person">Daniel</span> prospered in the reign of <span class="person">Darius</span>, and in the reign of <span class="person">Cyrus</span> the Persian.

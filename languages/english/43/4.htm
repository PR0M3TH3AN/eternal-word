<h3>Chapter 4 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> When therefore the LORD knew how the Pharisees had heard that <span class="person">Jesus</span> made and baptized more disciples than <span class="person">John</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> (Though <span class="person">Jesus</span> himself baptized not, but his disciples,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> He left <span class="place">Judaea</span>, and departed again into <span class="place">Galilee</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And he must needs go through <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Then cometh he to a city of <span class="place">Samaria</span>, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that <span class="person">Jacob</span> gave to his son <span class="person">Joseph</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Now <span class="person">Jacob</span>'s well was there. <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> There cometh a woman of <span class="place">Samaria</span> to draw water: <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto her, <span class="word">Give me to drink. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> Then saith the woman of <span class="place">Samaria</span> unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of <span class="place">Samaria</span>? for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered and said unto her, <span class="word">If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living water? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Art thou greater than our father <span class="person">Jacob</span>, which gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered and said unto her, <span class="word">Whosoever drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> <span class="word">But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto her, <span class="word">Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto her, Thou hast well said, <span class="word">I have no husband: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> <span class="word">For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> is the place where men ought to worship. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto her, <span class="word">Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, worship the Father.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> <span class="word">Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for salvation is of the Jews. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> <span class="word">But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="word">God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is called <span class="person">Christ</span>: when he is come, he will tell us all things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto her, <span class="word">I that speak unto thee am he. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why talkest thou with her? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the city, and saith to the men, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this the <span class="person">Christ</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master, eat. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> But he said unto them, <span class="word">I have meat to eat that ye know not of.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man brought him ought to eat? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto them, <span class="word">My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to finish his work.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="word">Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> <span class="word">And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> <span class="word">And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="word">I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that ever I did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And many more believed because of his own word; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the <span class="person">Christ</span>, the Saviour of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into <span class="place">Galilee</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> For <span class="person">Jesus</span> himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in his own country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Then when he was come into <span class="place">Galilee</span>, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> at the feast: for they also went unto the feast. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> So <span class="person">Jesus</span> came again into Cana of <span class="place">Galilee</span>, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at <span class="place">Capernaum</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> When he heard that <span class="person">Jesus</span> was come out of <span class="place">Judaea</span> into <span class="place">Galilee</span>, he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto him, <span class="word">Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto him, vGo thy way; thy son liveth.</span> And the man believed the word that <span class="person">Jesus</span> had spoken unto him, and he went his way. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told him, saying, Thy son liveth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto him, <span class="word">Thy son liveth:</span> and himself believed, and his whole house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> This is again the second miracle that <span class="person">Jesus</span> did, when he was come out of <span class="place">Judaea</span> into <span class="place">Galilee</span>.

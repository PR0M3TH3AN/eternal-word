<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> After these things <span class="person">Jesus</span> walked in <span class="place">Galilee</span>: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Now the Jews' feast of tabernacles was at hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go into <span class="place">Judaea</span>, that thy disciples also may see the works that thou doest. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things, shew thyself to the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> For neither did his brethren believe in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> Then <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto them, <span class="word">My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> <span class="word">The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> <span class="word">Go ye up unto this feast: I go not up yet unto this feast: for my time is not yet full come. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> When he had said these words unto them, he abode still in <span class="place">Galilee</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Then the Jews sought him at the feast, and said, Where is he? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he deceiveth the people. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Now about the midst of the feast <span class="person">Jesus</span> went up into the temple, and taught. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters, having never learned? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered them, and said, <span class="word">My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> <span class="word">If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> <span class="word">He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span><span class="word"> Did not <span class="person">Moses</span> give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth the law? Why go ye about to kill me? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> The people answered and said, Thou hast a devil: who goeth about to kill thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered and said unto them, <span class="word">I have done one work, and ye all marvel. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> <span class="word"><span class="person">Moses</span> therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is of <span class="person">Moses</span>, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day circumcise a man. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> <span class="word">If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of <span class="person">Moses</span> should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="word">Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Then said some of them of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, Is not this he, whom they seek to kill? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very <span class="person">Christ</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Howbeit we know this man whence he is: but when <span class="person">Christ</span> cometh, no man knoweth whence he is. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Then cried <span class="person">Jesus</span> in the temple as he taught, saying, <span class="word">Ye both know me, and ye know whence I am: and I am not come of myself, but he that sent me is true, whom ye know not.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> <span class="word">But I know him: for I am from him, and he hath sent me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Then they sought to take him: but no man laid hands on him, because his hour was not yet come. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When <span class="person">Christ</span> cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man hath done? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to take him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto them, <span class="word">Yet a little while am I with you, and then I go unto him that sent me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> <span class="word">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> What manner of saying is this that he said, <span class="word">Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> In the last day, that great day of the feast, <span class="person">Jesus</span> stood and cried, saying, <span class="word">If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="word">He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> (But this spake he of the Spirit, which they that believe on him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given; because that <span class="person">Jesus</span> was not yet glorified.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying, said, Of a truth this is the Prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Others said, This is the <span class="person">Christ</span>. But some said, Shall <span class="person">Christ</span> come out of <span class="place">Galilee</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> Hath not the scripture said, That <span class="person">Christ</span> cometh of the seed of <span class="person">David</span>, and out of the town of <span class="place">Bethlehem</span>, where <span class="person">David</span> was? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> So there was a division among the people because of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And some of them would have taken him; but no man laid hands on him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Then came the officers to the chief priests and Pharisees; and they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> The officers answered, Never man spake like this man. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> Then answered them the Pharisees, Are ye also deceived? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed on him? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> But this people who knoweth not the law are cursed. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> Nicodemus saith unto them, (he that came to <span class="person">Jesus</span> by night, being one of them,) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> Doth our law judge any man, before it hear him, and know what he doeth? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> They answered and said unto him, Art thou also of <span class="place">Galilee</span>? Search, and look: for out of <span class="place">Galilee</span> ariseth no prophet. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> And every man went unto his own house.

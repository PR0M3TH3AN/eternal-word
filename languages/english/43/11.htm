<h3>Chapter 11 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now a certain man was sick, named <span class="person">Lazarus</span>, of <span class="place">Bethany</span>, the town of <span class="person">Mary</span> and her sister <span class="person">Martha</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> (It was that <span class="person">Mary</span> which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother <span class="person">Lazarus</span> was sick.) 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> heard that, he said, <span class="word">This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be glorified thereby. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Now <span class="person">Jesus</span> loved <span class="person">Martha</span>, and her sister, and <span class="person">Lazarus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two days still in the same place where he was. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> Then after that saith he to his disciples, <span class="word">Let us go into <span class="place">Judaea</span> again. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to stone thee; and goest thou thither again? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span><span class="word"> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, <span class="word">Our friend <span class="person">Lazarus</span> sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Howbeit <span class="person">Jesus</span> spake of his death: but they thought that he had spoken of taking of rest in sleep. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then said <span class="person">Jesus</span> unto them plainly, <span class="word"><span class="person">Lazarus</span> is dead. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> <span class="word">And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then said <span class="person">Thomas</span>, which is called Didymus, unto his fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Then when <span class="person">Jesus</span> came, he found that he had lain in the grave four days already. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Now <span class="place">Bethany</span> was nigh unto <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, about fifteen furlongs off: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And many of the Jews came to <span class="person">Martha</span> and <span class="person">Mary</span>, to comfort them concerning their brother. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> Then <span class="person">Martha</span>, as soon as she heard that <span class="person">Jesus</span> was coming, went and met him: but <span class="person">Mary</span> sat still in the house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Then said <span class="person">Martha</span> unto <span class="person">Jesus</span>, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God, God will give it thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto her, <span class="word">Thy brother shall rise again. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> <span class="person">Martha</span> saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> said unto her, <span class="word">I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span><span class="word"> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die. Believest thou this? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the <span class="person">Christ</span>, the Son of God, which should come into the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called <span class="person">Mary</span> her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> Now <span class="person">Jesus</span> was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where <span class="person">Martha</span> met him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted her, when they saw <span class="person">Mary</span>, that she rose up hastily and went out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Then when <span class="person">Mary</span> was come where <span class="person">Jesus</span> was, and saw him, she fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And said, <span class="word">Where have ye laid him?</span> They said unto him, Lord, come and see. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> wept. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> said, <span class="word">Take ye away the stone.</span> <span class="person">Martha</span>, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh: for he hath been dead four days. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto her, <span class="word">Said I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God? </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead was laid. And <span class="person">Jesus</span> lifted up his eyes, and said, <span class="word">Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span><span class="word"> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that thou hast sent me. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice, <span class="word"><span class="person">Lazarus</span>, come forth. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin. <span class="person">Jesus</span> saith unto them, <span class="word">Loose him, and let him go. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Then many of the Jews which came to <span class="person">Mary</span>, and had seen the things which <span class="person">Jesus</span> did, believed on him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told them what things <span class="person">Jesus</span> had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> And one of them, named <span class="person">Caiaphas</span>, being the high priest that same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that <span class="person">Jesus</span> should die for that nation; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put him to death. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city called <span class="person">Ephraim</span>, and there continued with his disciples. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of the country up to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> before the passover, to purify themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> Then sought they for <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and spake among themselves, as they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come to the feast? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should shew it, that they might take him.

<h3>Chapter 19 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then <span class="person">Pilate</span> therefore took <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and scourged him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote him with their hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> therefore went forth again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> Then came <span class="person">Jesus</span> forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe. And <span class="person">Pilate</span> saith unto them, Behold the man! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> When the chief priests therefore and officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him. <span class="person">Pilate</span> saith unto them, Take ye him, and crucify him: for I find no fault in him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by our law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> When <span class="person">Pilate</span> therefore heard that saying, he was the more afraid; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And went again into the judgment hall, and saith unto <span class="person">Jesus</span>, Whence art thou? But <span class="person">Jesus</span> gave him no answer. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Then saith <span class="person">Pilate</span> unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? knowest thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to release thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> <span class="person">Jesus</span> answered, <span class="word">Thou couldest have no power at all against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin. </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And from thenceforth <span class="person">Pilate</span> sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this man go, thou art not <span class="person">Caesar</span>'s friend: whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against <span class="person">Caesar</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> When <span class="person">Pilate</span> therefore heard that saying, he brought <span class="person">Jesus</span> forth, and sat down in the judgment seat in a place that is called the Pavement, but in the Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And it was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour: and he saith unto the Jews, Behold your King! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> But they cried out, Away with him, away with him, crucify him. <span class="person">Pilate</span> saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but <span class="person">Caesar</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then delivered he him therefore unto them to be crucified. And they took <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and led him away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And he bearing his cross went forth into a place called the place of a skull, which is called in the Hebrew <span class="place">Golgotha</span>: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Where they crucified him, and two other with him, on either side one, and <span class="person">Jesus</span> in the midst. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And <span class="person">Pilate</span> wrote a title, and put it on the cross. And the writing was, JESUS OF NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where <span class="person">Jesus</span> was crucified was nigh to the city: and it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> Then said the chief priests of the Jews to <span class="person">Pilate</span>, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> <span class="person">Pilate</span> answered, What I have written I have written. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> Then the soldiers, when they had crucified <span class="person">Jesus</span>, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them, and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore the soldiers did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> Now there stood by the cross of <span class="person">Jesus</span> his mother, and his mother's sister, <span class="person">Mary</span> the wife of Cleophas, and <span class="person">Mary</span> <span class="person">Magdalene</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, <span class="word">Woman, behold thy son! </span>
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Then saith he to the disciple, <span class="word">Behold thy mother!</span> And from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> After this, <span class="person">Jesus</span> knowing that all things were now accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, <span class="word">I thirst.</span> 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> When <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore had received the vinegar, he said, <span class="word">It is finished:</span> and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day, (for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought <span class="person">Pilate</span> that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other which was crucified with him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> But when they came to <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and forthwith came there out blood and water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> For these things were done, that the scripture should be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And after this <span class="person">Joseph</span> of <span class="place">Arimathaea</span>, being a disciple of <span class="person">Jesus</span>, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought <span class="person">Pilate</span> that he might take away the body of <span class="person">Jesus</span>: and <span class="person">Pilate</span> gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the body of <span class="person">Jesus</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to <span class="person">Jesus</span> by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Then took they the body of <span class="person">Jesus</span>, and wound it in linen clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> There laid they <span class="person">Jesus</span> therefore because of the Jews' preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

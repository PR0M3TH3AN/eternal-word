<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> And certain men which came down from <span class="place">Judaea</span> taught the brethren, and said, Except ye be circumcised after the manner of <span class="person">Moses</span>, ye cannot be saved. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> When therefore <span class="person">Paul</span> and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that <span class="person">Paul</span> and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> unto the apostles and elders about this question. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phenice and <span class="place">Samaria</span>, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And when they were come to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, they were received of the church, and of the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And when there had been much disputing, <span class="person">Peter</span> rose up, and said unto them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he did unto us; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> But we believe that through the grace of the LORD <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span> we shall be saved, even as they. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and <span class="person">Paul</span>, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And after they had held their peace, <span class="person">James</span> answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> <span class="person">Simeon</span> hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of <span class="person">David</span>, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Wherefore my sentence is, that we trouble not them, which from among the Gentiles are turned to God: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> For <span class="person">Moses</span> of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with <span class="person">Paul</span> and Barnabas; namely, <span class="person">Judas</span> surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brethren send greeting unto the brethren which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and <span class="place">Syria</span> and Cilicia: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and <span class="person">Paul</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span> <span class="person">Christ</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> We have sent therefore <span class="person">Judas</span> and Silas, who shall also tell you the same things by mouth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> That ye abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if ye keep yourselves, ye shall do well. Fare ye well. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> Which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> And <span class="person">Judas</span> and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the apostles. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> <span class="person">Paul</span> also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> And some days after <span class="person">Paul</span> said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> And Barnabas determined to take with them <span class="person">John</span>, whose surname was Mark. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> But <span class="person">Paul</span> thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other: and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> And <span class="person">Paul</span> chose Silas, and departed, being recommended by the brethren unto the grace of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And he went through <span class="place">Syria</span> and Cilicia, confirming the churches.

<h3>Chapter 7 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then said the high priest, Are these things so? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father <span class="person">Abraham</span>, when he was in <span class="place">Mesopotamia</span>, before he dwelt in Charran, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall shew thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so <span class="person">Abraham</span> begat <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and circumcised him the eighth day; and <span class="person">Isaac</span> begat <span class="person">Jacob</span>; and <span class="person">Jacob</span> begat the twelve patriarchs. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold <span class="person">Joseph</span> into <span class="place">Egypt</span>: but God was with him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of <span class="place">Egypt</span>; and he made him governor over <span class="place">Egypt</span> and all his house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> Now there came a dearth over all the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span> and Chanaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> But when <span class="person">Jacob</span> heard that there was corn in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, he sent out our fathers first. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And at the second time <span class="person">Joseph</span> was made known to his brethren; and <span class="person">Joseph</span>'s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> Then sent <span class="person">Joseph</span>, and called his father <span class="person">Jacob</span> to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> So <span class="person">Jacob</span> went down into <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and died, he, and our fathers, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that <span class="person">Abraham</span> bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to <span class="person">Abraham</span>, the people grew and multiplied in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> Till another king arose, which knew not <span class="person">Joseph</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> The same dealt subtilly with our kindred, and evil entreated our fathers, so that they cast out their young children, to the end they might not live. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> In which time <span class="person">Moses</span> was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished up in his father's house three months: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And <span class="person">Moses</span> was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And when he was full forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the next day he shewed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> Then fled <span class="person">Moses</span> at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Madian, where he begat two sons. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sina an angel of the Lord in a flame of fire in a bush. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> When <span class="person">Moses</span> saw it, he wondered at the sight: and as he drew near to behold it, the voice of the LORD came unto him, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> Saying, I am the God of thy fathers, the God of <span class="person">Abraham</span>, and the God of <span class="person">Isaac</span>, and the God of <span class="person">Jacob</span>. Then <span class="person">Moses</span> trembled, and durst not behold. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people which is in <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into <span class="place">Egypt</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> This <span class="person">Moses</span> whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send to be a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel which appeared to him in the bush. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> He brought them out, after that he had shewed wonders and signs in the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> This is that <span class="person">Moses</span>, which said unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> This is he, that was in the church in the wilderness with the angel which spake to him in the mount Sina, and with our fathers: who received the lively oracles to give unto us: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="39">39</span> To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into <span class="place">Egypt</span>, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="40">40</span> Saying unto <span class="person">Aaron</span>, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this <span class="person">Moses</span>, which brought us out of the land of <span class="place">Egypt</span>, we wot not what is become of him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="41">41</span> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="42">42</span> Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of <span class="place">Israel</span>, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="43">43</span> Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond <span class="place">Babylon</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="44">44</span> Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto <span class="person">Moses</span>, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="45">45</span> Which also our fathers that came after brought in with <span class="person">Jesus</span> into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of <span class="person">David</span>; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="46">46</span> Who found favour before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of <span class="person">Jacob</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="47">47</span> But <span class="person">Solomon</span> built him an house. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="48">48</span> Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="49">49</span> Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what is the place of my rest? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="50">50</span> Hath not my hand made all these things? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="51">51</span> Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="52">52</span> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them which shewed before of the coming of the Just One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="53">53</span> Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="54">54</span> When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed on him with their teeth. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="55">55</span> But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and <span class="person">Jesus</span> standing on the right hand of God, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="56">56</span> And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="57">57</span> Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord, 
<br /><span class="verse" id="58">58</span> And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was <span class="person">Saul</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="59">59</span> And they stoned Stephen, calling upon God, and saying, Lord <span class="person">Jesus</span>, receive my spirit. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="60">60</span> And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.

<h3>Chapter 14 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> In the second year of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of <span class="place">Israel</span> reigned Amaziah the son of Joash king of <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> He was twenty and five years old when he began to reign, and reigned twenty and nine years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Jehoaddan of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, yet not like <span class="person">David</span> his father: he did according to all things as Joash his father did. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Howbeit the high places were not taken away: as yet the people did sacrifice and burnt incense on the high places. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And it came to pass, as soon as the kingdom was confirmed in his hand, that he slew his servants which had slain the king his father. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> But the children of the murderers he slew not: according unto that which is written in the book of the law of <span class="person">Moses</span>, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> He slew of <span class="person">Edom</span> in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel unto this day. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> Then Amaziah sent messengers to Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz son of Jehu, king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, saying, Come, let us look one another in the face. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And Jehoash the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> sent to Amaziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife: and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and trode down the thistle. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> Thou hast indeed smitten <span class="person">Edom</span>, and thine heart hath lifted thee up: glory of this, and tarry at home: for why shouldest thou meddle to thy hurt, that thou shouldest fall, even thou, and <span class="person">Judah</span> with thee? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> But Amaziah would not hear. Therefore Jehoash king of <span class="place">Israel</span> went up; and he and Amaziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> looked one another in the face at Bethshemesh, which belongeth to <span class="person">Judah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And <span class="person">Judah</span> was put to the worse before <span class="place">Israel</span>; and they fled every man to their tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Jehoash king of <span class="place">Israel</span> took Amaziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>, and brake down the wall of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> from the gate of <span class="person">Ephraim</span> unto the corner gate, four hundred cubits. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And he took all the gold and silver, and all the vessels that were found in the house of the LORD, and in the treasures of the king's house, and hostages, and returned to <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jehoash which he did, and his might, and how he fought with Amaziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And Jehoash slept with his fathers, and was buried in <span class="place">Samaria</span> with the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and Jeroboam his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> And Amaziah the son of Joash king of <span class="person">Judah</span> lived after the death of Jehoash son of Jehoahaz king of <span class="place">Israel</span> fifteen years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And the rest of the acts of Amaziah, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Now they made a conspiracy against him in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>: and he fled to Lachish; but they sent after him to Lachish, and slew him there. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And they brought him on horses: and he was buried at <span class="place">Jerusalem</span> with his fathers in the city of <span class="person">David</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And all the people of <span class="person">Judah</span> took Azariah, which was sixteen years old, and made him king instead of his father Amaziah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> He built Elath, and restored it to <span class="person">Judah</span>, after that the king slept with his fathers. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> In the fifteenth year of Amaziah the son of Joash king of <span class="person">Judah</span> Jeroboam the son of Joash king of <span class="place">Israel</span> began to reign in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and reigned forty and one years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from all the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> He restored the coast of <span class="place">Israel</span> from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of <span class="place">Israel</span>, which he spake by the hand of his servant <span class="person">Jonah</span>, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> For the LORD saw the affliction of <span class="place">Israel</span>, that it was very bitter: for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And the LORD said not that he would blot out the name of <span class="place">Israel</span> from under heaven: but he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam the son of Joash. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered <span class="place">Damascus</span>, and Hamath, which belonged to <span class="person">Judah</span>, for <span class="place">Israel</span>, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>; and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead.

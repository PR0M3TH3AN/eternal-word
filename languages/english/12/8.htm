<h3>Chapter 8 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Then spake Elisha unto the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go thou and thine household, and sojourn wheresoever thou canst sojourn: for the LORD hath called for a famine; and it shall also come upon the land seven years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And the woman arose, and did after the saying of the man of God: and she went with her household, and sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And it came to pass at the seven years' end, that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines: and she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And the king talked with Gehazi the servant of the man of God, saying, Tell me, I pray thee, all the great things that Elisha hath done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land. And Gehazi said, My lord, O king, this is the woman, and this is her son, whom Elisha restored to life. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And when the king asked the woman, she told him. So the king appointed unto her a certain officer, saying, Restore all that was hers, and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land, even until now. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And Elisha came to <span class="place">Damascus</span>; and Benhadad the king of <span class="place">Syria</span> was sick; and it was told him, saying, The man of God is come hither. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And the king said unto Hazael, Take a present in thine hand, and go, meet the man of God, and enquire of the LORD by him, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> So Hazael went to meet him, and took a present with him, even of every good thing of <span class="place">Damascus</span>, forty camels' burden, and came and stood before him, and said, Thy son Benhadad king of <span class="place">Syria</span> hath sent me to thee, saying, Shall I recover of this disease? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Elisha said unto him, Go, say unto him, Thou mayest certainly recover: howbeit the LORD hath shewed me that he shall surely die. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And he settled his countenance stedfastly, until he was ashamed: and the man of God wept. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And Hazael said, Why weepeth my lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil that thou wilt do unto the children of <span class="place">Israel</span>: their strong holds wilt thou set on fire, and their young men wilt thou slay with the sword, and wilt dash their children, and rip up their women with child. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Hazael said, But what, is thy servant a dog, that he should do this great thing? And Elisha answered, The LORD hath shewed me that thou shalt be king over <span class="place">Syria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> So he departed from Elisha, and came to his master; who said to him, What said Elisha to thee? And he answered, He told me that thou shouldest surely recover. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And it came to pass on the morrow, that he took a thick cloth, and dipped it in water, and spread it on his face, so that he died: and Hazael reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And in the fifth year of <span class="person">Joram</span> the son of Ahab king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, Jehoshaphat being then king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, Jehoram the son of Je hoshaphat king of <span class="person">Judah</span> began to reign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign; and he reigned eight years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he walked in the way of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>, as did the house of Ahab: for the daughter of Ahab was his wife: and he did evil in the sight of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> Yet the LORD would not destroy <span class="person">Judah</span> for <span class="person">David</span> his servant's sake, as he promised him to give him alway a light, and to his children. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> In his days <span class="person">Edom</span> revolted from under the hand of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and made a king over themselves. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> So <span class="person">Joram</span> went over to Zair, and all the chariots with him: and he rose by night, and smote the Edomites which compassed him about, and the captains of the chariots: and the people fled into their tents. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> Yet <span class="person">Edom</span> revolted from under the hand of <span class="person">Judah</span> unto this day. Then Libnah revolted at the same time. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And the rest of the acts of <span class="person">Joram</span>, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And <span class="person">Joram</span> slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <span class="person">David</span>: and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> In the twelfth year of <span class="person">Joram</span> the son of Ahab king of <span class="place">Israel</span> did Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of <span class="person">Judah</span> begin to reign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> Two and twenty years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign; and he reigned one year in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Athaliah, the daughter of Omri king of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> And he walked in the way of the house of Ahab, and did evil in the sight of the LORD, as did the house of Ahab: for he was the son in law of the house of Ahab. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And he went with <span class="person">Joram</span> the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of <span class="place">Syria</span> in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded <span class="person">Joram</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> And king <span class="person">Joram</span> went back to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him at Ramah, when he fought against Hazael king of <span class="place">Syria</span>. And Ahaziah the son of Jehoram king of <span class="person">Judah</span> went down to see <span class="person">Joram</span> the son of Ahab in Jezreel, because he was sick.

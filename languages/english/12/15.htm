<h3>Chapter 15 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> In the twenty and seventh year of Jeroboam king of <span class="place">Israel</span> began Azariah son of Amaziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> to reign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> Sixteen years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned two and fifty years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Jecholiah of <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, according to all that his father Amaziah had done; 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> Save that the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burnt incense still on the high places. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> And the LORD smote the king, so that he was a leper unto the day of his death, and dwelt in a several house. And Jotham the king's son was over the house, judging the people of the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And the rest of the acts of Azariah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> So Azariah slept with his fathers; and they buried him with his fathers in the city of <span class="person">David</span>: and Jotham his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> In the thirty and eighth year of Azariah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> did Zachariah the son of Jeroboam reign over <span class="place">Israel</span> in <span class="place">Samaria</span> six months. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his fathers had done: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And Shallum the son of Jabesh conspired against him, and smote him before the people, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> And the rest of the acts of Zachariah, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> This was the word of the LORD which he spake unto Jehu, saying, Thy sons shall sit on the throne of <span class="place">Israel</span> unto the fourth generation. And so it came to pass. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> Shallum the son of Jabesh began to reign in the nine and thirtieth year of Uzziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span>; and he reigned a full month in <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> For Menahem the son of Gadi went up from Tirzah, and came to <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and smote Shallum the son of Jabesh in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and slew him, and reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> And the rest of the acts of Shallum, and his conspiracy which he made, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> Then Menahem smote Tiphsah, and all that were therein, and the coasts thereof from Tirzah: because they opened not to him, therefore he smote it; and all the women therein that were with child he ripped up. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> In the nine and thirtieth year of Azariah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> began Menahem the son of Gadi to reign over <span class="place">Israel</span>, and reigned ten years in <span class="place">Samaria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not all his days from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And Pul the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span> came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And Menahem exacted the money of <span class="place">Israel</span>, even of all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to give to the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>. So the king of <span class="place">Assyria</span> turned back, and stayed not there in the land. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And the rest of the acts of Menahem, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And Menahem slept with his fathers; and Pekahiah his son reigned in his stead. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> In the fiftieth year of Azariah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> Pekahiah the son of Menahem began to reign over <span class="place">Israel</span> in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and reigned two years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> But Pekah the son of Remaliah, a captain of his, conspired against him, and smote him in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, in the palace of the king's house, with Argob and Arieh, and with him fifty men of the Gileadites: and he killed him, and reigned in his room. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And the rest of the acts of Pekahiah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> In the two and fiftieth year of Azariah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> Pekah the son of Remaliah began to reign over <span class="place">Israel</span> in <span class="place">Samaria</span>, and reigned twenty years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="28">28</span> And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD: he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="29">29</span> In the days of Pekah king of <span class="place">Israel</span> came Tiglathpileser king of <span class="place">Assyria</span>, and took Ijon, and Abelbethmaachah, and Janoah, and Kedesh, and Hazor, and <span class="place">Gilead</span>, and <span class="place">Galilee</span>, all the land of <span class="person">Naphtali</span>, and carried them captive to <span class="place">Assyria</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="30">30</span> And Hoshea the son of <span class="person">Elah</span> made a conspiracy against Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his stead, in the twentieth year of Jotham the son of Uzziah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="31">31</span> And the rest of the acts of Pekah, and all that he did, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="32">32</span> In the second year of Pekah the son of Remaliah king of <span class="place">Israel</span> began Jotham the son of Uzziah king of <span class="person">Judah</span> to reign. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="33">33</span> Five and twenty years old was he when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in <span class="place">Jerusalem</span>. And his mother's name was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="34">34</span> And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD: he did according to all that his father Uzziah had done. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="35">35</span> Howbeit the high places were not removed: the people sacrificed and burned incense still in the high places. He built the higher gate of the house of the LORD. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="36">36</span> Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of <span class="person">Judah</span>? 
<br /><span class="verse" id="37">37</span> In those days the LORD began to send against <span class="person">Judah</span> Rezin the king of <span class="place">Syria</span>, and Pekah the son of Remaliah. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="38">38</span> And Jotham slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of <span class="person">David</span> his father: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

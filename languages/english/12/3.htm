<h3>Chapter 3 </h3>
<!--... the Word of God:--> 
<p><span class="verse" id="1">1</span> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over <span class="place">Israel</span> in <span class="place">Samaria</span> the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and reigned twelve years. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="2">2</span> And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="3">3</span> Nevertheless he cleaved unto the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made <span class="place">Israel</span> to sin; he departed not therefrom. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="4">4</span> And <span class="place">Mesha</span> king of <span class="person">Moab</span> was a sheepmaster, and rendered unto the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="5">5</span> But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of <span class="person">Moab</span> rebelled against the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="6">6</span> And king Jehoram went out of <span class="place">Samaria</span> the same time, and numbered all <span class="place">Israel</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="7">7</span> And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, saying, The king of <span class="person">Moab</span> hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against <span class="person">Moab</span> to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="8">8</span> And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of <span class="person">Edom</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="9">9</span> So the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> went, and the king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, and the king of <span class="person">Edom</span>: and they fetched a compass of seven days' journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="10">10</span> And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of <span class="person">Moab</span>! 
<br /><span class="verse" id="11">11</span> But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>'s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of <span class="person">Elijah</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="12">12</span> And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> and Jehoshaphat and the king of <span class="person">Edom</span> went down to him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="13">13</span> And Elisha said unto the king of <span class="place">Israel</span>, What have I to do with thee? get thee to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of <span class="place">Israel</span> said unto him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of <span class="person">Moab</span>. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="14">14</span> And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of <span class="person">Judah</span>, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="15">15</span> But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="16">16</span> And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="17">17</span> For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="18">18</span> And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="19">19</span> And ye shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="20">20</span> And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of <span class="person">Edom</span>, and the country was filled with water. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="21">21</span> And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="22">22</span> And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood: 
<br /><span class="verse" id="23">23</span> And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, <span class="person">Moab</span>, to the spoil. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="24">24</span> And when they came to the camp of <span class="place">Israel</span>, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="25">25</span> And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; howbeit the slingers went about it, and smote it. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="26">26</span> And when the king of <span class="person">Moab</span> saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even unto the king of <span class="person">Edom</span>: but they could not. 
<br /><span class="verse" id="27">27</span> Then he took his eldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against <span class="place">Israel</span>: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.
